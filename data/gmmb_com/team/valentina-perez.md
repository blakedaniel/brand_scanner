Valentina Perez
===============


###### Senior Vice President 
  / Politics


Valentina works with GMMB’s political and issue clients to craft messages that make an impact and reach the people that need to hear them. Valentina has coordinated digital advertising for political campaigns up and down the ballot, from U.S. presidential and gubernatorial races to state legislative and ballot initiative campaigns. Most recently, she helped Democrats defy the odds in 2022 to hold and gain seats in the U.S. Senate, House, and state capitals across the country. She worked with clients including Senate Majority PAC, Democratic Governors Association, Everytown for Gun Safety, Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and Senator Ron Wyden as a strategic lead, creating memorable ads and planning multi-million dollar paid digital advertising campaigns. Valentina also advised and helped execute Joe Biden’s $200M+ digital ads program in his successful 2020 presidential campaign. As part of this work, she managed the Biden for President eight-figure Latinx digital persuasion ads program, paying close attention to the nuances of Latinx communities in target battleground states.


Along with her political experience, Valentina has worked with foundations and nonprofits to craft memorable messages for advertising, earned media, and communications campaigns. Prior to joining GMMB, Valentina worked on Hillary for America’s research team in the campaign’s Brooklyn headquarters, with previous experience at political consulting and advertising firms in New York City and Washington, D.C. She was born in Venezuela and is a graduate of Harvard University.
