###### Partner 
  / Politics


In 2017, *POLITICO* named Anson to their “new guard power list,” calling him a “go-to ad guru for top candidates.” And with good reason. An award-winning media strategist, Anson has taken on leading roles in some of the highest-profile, hardest-fought campaigns of the past twenty years. As a senior member of Hillary Clinton’s presidential paid media team in 2016, ads he wrote, directed, and produced were called “masterful,” “powerful,” “brilliant,” and “the most memorable in years.” In 2012, he helped reelect President Obama, with ads that ran nationally and in battleground states. Its the same purpose driven commitment he’s brought to campaigns across the country, at the local, state and national level. Anson’s work extends outside the political realm as well, having provided strategic counsel to national and multinational nonprofit and Fortune 500 clients like the American Lung Association, Cisco Systems, and MGM Resorts International.
