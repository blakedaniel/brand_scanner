Peter co-directs GMMB’s award-winning Creative Content Group. With more than 25 years of experience, he leads an inspired team of creative directors, writers, editors and producers—the right mix of talent for every assignment, large or small. They bring passion and creativity to each project—from creating ads for winning presidential and national issue campaigns to developing dynamic short films.


With substantial in-house broadcast capabilities, including pre- and post-production, GMMB has the tools to get the job done: nine edit suites, 3D/2D animation, motion graphics and color correction. Peter and his team use their craft to connect emotionally with audiences here in the U.S. and around the globe. They measure success by creating content that drives action—whether it’s connecting families to affordable health coverage or rallying voters to back a candidate or cause.
