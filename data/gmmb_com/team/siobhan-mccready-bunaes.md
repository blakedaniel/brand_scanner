Siobhan McCready Bunaes
=======================


###### Managing Director, Senior Vice President 
  / Public Health


For more than 25 years, Siobhan has been helping realize cause campaigns. Her expertise has been critical on national campaigns devoted to child safety, women’s heart disease, eye health, systems biology and health insurance coverage for children and low-income families. Most recently, she worked with the Women’s Heart Alliance to launch a national campaign called Fight the Ladykiller to raise awareness of heart disease—the number one killer of women.


Prior to GMMB, she led marketing and communications at the American Academy of Ophthalmology, where she launched EyeSmart, an eye health campaign.
