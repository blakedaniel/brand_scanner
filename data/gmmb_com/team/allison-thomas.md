Allison Thomas
==============


###### Senior Vice President, Managing Director


Allison is an account planner and data enthusiast who focuses on inspiring smart strategy and breakthrough campaigns with meaningful audience insights. She’s skilled in shaping traditional and new research methods—from focus groups and surveys to ethnographies and social listening—to identify audiences, understand motivations and uncover new opportunities.


Allison’s work has sparked creative strategy and engaged audiences for the Women’s Heart Alliance’s Fight the Ladykiller campaign by identifying women’s deeply held beliefs around heart disease, and informed development of the United Nations Foundation’s Girl Up campaign by putting U.S. teens at the center of global girls’ empowerment.


As the firm’s strategic planning and research team lead, Allison’s work spans situation analysis, strategic communications planning, audience identification, concept and materials testing, and benchmarking and evaluation studies.
