###### Senior Vice President, Managing Director 
  / Corporate Social Impact


From managing advertising campaigns in support of health reform to overseeing outreach and education efforts to enroll Americans in health coverage, Melissa is on the front lines of the Affordable Care Act’s implementation. She worked with Vermont and Washington State to introduce their marketplaces and enroll residents, with AARP to educate consumers about the ACA and Medicare, and with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to educate families about low-cost health insurance options available for their children.


Melissa currently leads GMMB’s work with Missouri Foundation for Health to address childhood obesity. In addition to health coverage projects, Melissa brings her media buying experience to integrated advertising campaigns, most recently managing a campaign to bring the story of the AT&T Aspire education initiative to life.
