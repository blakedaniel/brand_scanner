###### Partner


Janet specializes in helping nonprofits raise their profiles through branding and reputation management. She offers sharp insights and wisdom to help organizations successfully navigate change. Both qualities make her a natural leader of GMMB’s brand group and an adept counselor for her clients’ challenges. For more than 20 years, she’s brought an audience-centric approach to communications, helping clients like AFSCME, the College of the Holy Cross and the American Heart Association make stronger connections with the people that matter to them. The result: communications work that isn’t simply adopted, but embraced.


Janet forges deep and lasting relationships with her clients because she cares as much as they do about issues like the environment, education, health and social justice. She provides expert counsel on message development, paid and earned media outreach and online engagement strategies. An expert in designing communications matched for each client’s specific need, she’s worked with leading philanthropies like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, trade associations like the Auto Care Association and national nonprofits like the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights. Janet’s distinctive imprint transforms her clients’ communications strategies, making them ever smarter, more human and more relevant.
