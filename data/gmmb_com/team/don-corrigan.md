Don Corrigan
============


###### Senior Vice President, Creative Director


With 30 years of agency experience as a copywriter and creative director, Don has developed effective advertising campaigns for a dizzyingly diverse set of clients, from giant hotel chains and leading pharmaceutical companies to small nonprofits and minor league baseball teams.


In his time at GMMB, Don has applied an audience-first approach to help our clients affect positive change. Heâ€™s worked to enroll uninsured Marylanders for Maryland Health Connection, inform and mobilize older voters for AARP and convince people to stick to their regular check-up schedule for the American Dental Association.


Working with clients to uncover new ways to communicate with their audiences and deliver results is what drives Don and what makes him love coming to work at GMMB every day.
