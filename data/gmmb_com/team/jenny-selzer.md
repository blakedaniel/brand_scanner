Jenny Selzer
============


###### Senior Vice President


Jenny is a lifelong lover of language and deeply believes in the power of words to change the world. She lives for a well-timed one-liner or perfectly pithy emotional detail, finding that often humor and empathy can help draw an audience into even the most complicated or intimidating policy issue. Jenny specializes in rapid response advertising campaigns and using paid media to achieve advocacy and legislative goals. She has led strategy and ad development for GMMB’s AARP state advocacy work since 2011. She has helped AARP pass legislation beneficial to seniors and their families on a broad array of issues including cost of utilities, retirement savings, and family caregiving. Jenny has also been integral to the development and production of AARP’s federal advocacy campaigns on Social Security, Medicare, the Affordable Care Act, fraud prevention, and family caregiving, which have won Addy and Pollie awards for television and online ads.   Before joining GMMB, Jenny worked for frontline Democratic members of Congress providing policy, communications, and strategic counsel. Jenny is a proud graduate of Northwestern University and lives in Washington DC with her husband, Juan, and opinionated toddler, Diego.
