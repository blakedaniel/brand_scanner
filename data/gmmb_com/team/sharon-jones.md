Sharon Jones
============


###### Partner


For more than 25 years, Sharon has managed all aspects of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and Human Resources for organizations such as Save the Children, Inclusion @ Work, Ketchum Inc. and Coca-Cola, three of the leading companies in their respective industries.


Her areas of expertise include diversity, equity and inclusion, talent management, organizational development, talent development, succession planning, internal communications, talent acquisition, compensation, and employee relations for multiple geographies.


As GMMB’s, first-ever CDEIG Officer, Sharon will guide the firm along the way, advocate for staff and hold us accountable. We are redoubling our commitment to diversity and inclusion means attracting more people of color and creating a culture where everyone can succeed and thrive. It means developing and actively advancing the careers of people of color who already are at GMMB. It means intensive listening, educating ourselves, and taking measurable action.


Sharon will report directly to GMMB’s partner group. She will lead an office that includes GMMB’s Human Resources Director and HR team, and work closely with GMMB’s DEI team, which is comprised of a cross section of employees from all levels of the firm.


For us, this is not a moment, and it’s not a campaign or a slogan or empty PR promises.  It’s the beginning of a comprehensive journey that we are taking wholeheartedly with our staff, new GMMB team members to come, and outside experts, partners who are helping guide us on our path, and Sharon’s passion, experience and expertise.
