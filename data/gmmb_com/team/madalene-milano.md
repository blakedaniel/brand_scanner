###### Partner 
  / Corporate Social Impact


Madalene Milano brings more than 32 years of experience in managing, developing and implementing results-driven communications, including media relations, advertising, social marketing, partnership building and brand management. Since joining GMMB in 1994, Madalene has partnered with a range of clients—from nonprofits to leading industries—bringing her brand of research-driven common-sense solutions to solve significant challenges.


Madalene is an accomplished practitioner of public health and public safety campaigns. Her expertise in advocacy, campaign management and advertising has helped change behaviors and laws across the country, including increasing tobacco taxes to fund youth prevention programs and passing smoke-free air laws. Her innovative thinking helped create the new social norm of putting kids in the back seats of cars, raise seat belt use to an all-time high and make it harder for intoxicated drivers to get behind the wheel. Madalene currently serves on the National Board of MADD.
