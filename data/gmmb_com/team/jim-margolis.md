Jim Margolis
============


###### Partner 
  / Politics


Jim Margolis got his start in politics at age 15 in Kalamazoo, Michigan. It was there that he was Field Director for an inspirational – but losing – congressional candidate (perhaps the aspiring congressman should have hired a lead organizer old enough to drive). Thankfully, since that defeat, Jim has been more successful helping candidates, corporations, advocacy groups, foundations and government agencies develop strategic communications and advertising programs that impact people’s lives and help change the world.


As a founding partner of GMMB, Jim served as a senior advisor to Barack Obama in both the former President’s campaigns for the White House, leading each cycle’s half-billion dollar advertising effort and helping direct the campaign as part of the core strategic team. Jim also co-produced the two Obama inaugural celebrations and both of Mr. Obama’s national conventions. In the 2016 presidential election, Jim served as senior advisor to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, leading her paid advertising effort and co-producing the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.


Nationally, Jim has helped elect dozens of senators, governors and other public servants to office. From Oregon to Florida, from North Dakota to Puerto Rico, his strategic advice and award-winning creative has helped turn amazing candidates into forceful officeholders. Similarly, overseas, Jim has advised progressive presidential and prime ministerial candidates in Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin America.


In the business and philanthropic world, Jim has provided counsel to some of America’s most iconic corporations and nonprofits, including AT&T, AFSCME, Airbnb, AMERICORPS, Ashoka, Cisco Systems, Facebook, The Gates Foundation, L’Oréal, Microsoft, The Pritzker Foundation and VISA.


Before joining GMMB, Jim served as a top appointee in both the U.S. House and U.S. Senate.
