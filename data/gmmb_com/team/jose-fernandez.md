José Fernandez
==============


###### Senior Vice President, Creative Director


José honed his skills as an Art Director working for different advertising agencies in Spain before moving to the United States to earn an MFA in Digital+Media at the Rhode Island School of Design, where his thesis work won Award of Excellence.


He has over 15 years of experience specializing in bilingual creative strategy and creating campaigns in English and Spanish. He has worked for a wide range of clients, including multinational car brands like Toyota and nonprofit media organizations like NPR.


Always a student, José is driven by research and finding new ways to connect organizations with their audiences in a meaningful way. He is a versatile creative with a vivid imagination and a soft spot for art and technology, but his knowledge of marketing, advertising, and branding go far deeper.


At GMMB, José leads and develops campaigns to advance issues in public health and consumer protection, most notably for clients like AARP, Washington Regional Alcohol Program, and Tobacco Free Kids.


Outside of GMMB, José speaks at art panels and technical and creative workshops.
