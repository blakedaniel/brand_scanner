Ellen Frawley
=============


###### Partner


Ellen is the leader you want around when the challenge is big and the timing tight. A veteran strategist with more than 25 years working on issues and causes across sectors—from startups to NGOs—she brings a powerful blend of possibility and pragmatism that guides clients and teams toward new solutions and measurable success.


Ellen designs and manages large-scale national communications efforts, including media and partnership strategies, message and creative development, and advanced audience targeting. She led the GMMB team that created and launched the Women’s Heart Alliance and the award-winning Fight the Ladykiller campaign, which employs new strategies to combat women’s heart disease.


Whether engaging more Americans in volunteering or assisting military families to become better financially prepared, Ellen is committed to advancing positive change in people’s lives. Outside of GMMB, Ellen serves on the national board of directors of Friends of the Children, a unique mentoring program serving our most vulnerable children from kindergarten through high school.
