###### Senior Vice President


Anne brings more than 15 years of experience in marketing and communications to GMMB, where she leads projects and campaigns to support nonprofit and philanthropic organizations focused on a range of issues, including public health, science, climate change, housing affordability and ending homelessness, criminal justice reform, furthering racial equity, domestic and global education, global health, and more. She believes that finding—and telling—the right stories drives powerful social change, and she has a knack for helping organizations frame their work in compelling and engaging ways to make the greatest impact.


Prior to joining GMMB in 2018, Anne oversaw marketing and communications for Asia Society’s Center for Global Education. Previously, she worked at the League of Education Voters and at the University of Washington in Seattle. She also speaks Korean and German and spent three years in Korea through a Fulbright teaching grant.
