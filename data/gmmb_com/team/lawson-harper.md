Harper Lawson brings together a combination of state and national experience in communications, government, and campaign management. With distinct creative approaches and an authentic writing style, he creates messaging and strategy that helps connect directly with voters—helping GMMB’s clients, campaigns, and causes define the narrative early and win tough races down the stretch.


At GMMB, Harper has crafted award-winning advertising in support of multiple statewide candidates, including Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak, Montana Governor Steve Bullock, and Kansas Governor Laura Kelly. Over the years, he’s written, produced, and directed ads for the Democratic Governors Association, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Senate Majority PAC, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and the League of Conservation Voters, as well as developing advertising and media strategy for several statewide ballot initiatives on public health, minimum wage, paid sick leave, voting rights, education funding, and environmental protection.


Harper has managed gubernatorial campaigns, worked as a communications director on the Hill, and served as Montana’s chief deputy secretary of state.


Harper lives in Helena, Montana.
