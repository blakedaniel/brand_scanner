Annie’s steadfast leadership, hands-on mentorship, and business savvy have established GMMB as an international leader in strategic communications. By cultivating an environment focused on excellence, collegiality, and respect, Annie has guided GMMB to achieve its reputation for exceptional client services and as a great place to work.


Annie got her start in politics working in presidential and California politics and has been a strong supporter of women and progressive candidates across the country for the past 30 years. Abroad, Annie’s international political experience includes media training women activists in Poland for the National Democratic Institute (NDI), and developing NDI’s field strategy and training to help defeat Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, a campaign depicted in the Academy Awards Nominated movie ***NO***.


Currently, Annie oversees GMMB’s work to protect and advance high-quality, affordable health coverage for kids and families, working with child health advocates across the country in partnership with Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families. She also manages a major digital and creative ad campaign for the American Dental Association. Previously, Annie has directed the creation and implementation of communications campaigns for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s Covering Kids and Families (CKF) Communications Campaign. CKF helped to enroll 11 million children in CHIP and Medicaid, and Annie’s strategy now serves as a model in strategic communications textbooks.


At crucial stages in the firm’s growth, she has expanded capabilities, scope, and impact. Known affectionately as “the B” in GMMB, Annie Burns sets the standard for leadership, mentorship, and business savvy in progressive communications.
