###### Partner


With nearly 30 years of experience in strategic communications, Will leads innovative programs and positioning campaigns for organizations looking to strengthen their identities, increase their profiles and improve the public good. From branding initiatives to public health and corporate reputation campaigns, he brings in-depth experience in strategic planning, creative development and traditional and digital marketing approaches that work together to spur support, foster engagement and create lasting change.

Will’s present and past clients include the American Public Transportation Association, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, USTelecom, National Safety Council, National Cable and Telecommunications Association, Chrysler and the Society for Human Resource Management.


In addition to his strategic communications work, Will also co-directs GMMB’s Creative Content Group, helping clients craft advertising, video and digital assets that are smart, creative and drive real impact.
