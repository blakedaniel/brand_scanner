Joseph Garcia
=============


###### Senior Vice President


Joseph has spent his professional life where finding moving words and powerful images intersects with expanding opportunity. That’s taken him to the nation’s fourth largest school system to run communications, to Washington, DC, to push for higher expectations for all students, to Durham, NC, to help preeminent health researchers find their voices, and to St. Tammany Parish, LA, to report on schools and hospitals. At GMMB, his focus is on clients whose work improves education and population health, providing them communications strategy, content creation, positioning, and advocacy support.
