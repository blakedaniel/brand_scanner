Jacquie Lawing Ebert
====================


###### Partner


Jacquie develops and executes research-based strategies that ensure powerful change takes hold and is sustainable in our nation’s communities. She has spearheaded much of GMMB’s work to improve the nation’s education system so all young people can succeed.


Years of experience working in Congress, on the 1992 Presidential campaign and as a Deputy Assistant Secretary and Chief of Staff at the Department of Housing and Urban Development give her a deep understanding of the nexus of politics, policy, and advocacy.


Whether it’s developing and executing a strategy to ensure bipartisan support for and strong implementation of high standards for advocacy organizations, working with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to elevate the perspectives of critical stakeholders like students and teachers through insightful and fresh research, or advising clients on Personalized Learning communications, Jacquie will not stop until the job is done.
