I came to work at GMMB because I wanted to be a part of “causing the effect.”
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

But that means so much more to me now that I’m here. Nothing compares to working with passionate, brilliant, creative people every day, who work tirelessly in pursuit of making the world better than they found it. It’s a huge motivator and inspiration – my colleagues don’t just cause the effect in the world, but on me as well and I only hope to do the same for them.

GMMB has given me the right balance of support and encouragement to take risks.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
It’s a place where staff are empowered to think creatively and dynamically, and there is a strong sense of optimism underpinning all that we do – that the sky is the limit in terms of the impact we can and should have for our clients and the world.

I came because the firm has an impressive roster of political, nonprofit, and issue clients.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I’ve stayed because of my colleagues and the skills I’ve built working with those clients. I’ve been fortunate to help elect all types of candidates I admire and believe in, from local city officials to members of Congress to President Joe Biden. And the creative, talented, and driven people at GMMB alongside me in those campaigns have taught me countless skills and made our work fun and worthwhile.

I’ve found my work home at GMMB!
--------------------------------

A place where I feel an incredible sense of belonging and can bring my authentic self, quirks and all! I’m challenged, supported, and inspired by my fellow GMMBers, who are deeply committed to advancing the important diversity, equity and inclusion work that creates real and lasting change in the world. And, we know how to have fun!

GMMB brings together individuals who genuinely want to make a difference in the world
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It’s inspiring to be surrounded by colleagues who bring both skill and passion to our work. I think that passion shines through in our campaigns and helps effect change in our nation and beyond.
