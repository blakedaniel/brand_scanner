**WASHINGTON** – Today, GMMB announced the appointment of **Sharon V. Jones** as its Chief Diversity, Equity, Inclusion (DEI) & Growth Officer. Jones, who joins GMMB as a managing director, will help lead DEI within the firm.


Jones will report directly to GMMB’s partner group. She will lead an office that includes GMMB’s Human Resources Director and HR team, and work closely with GMMB’s DEI team, which is comprised of a cross section of employees from all levels of the firm.
