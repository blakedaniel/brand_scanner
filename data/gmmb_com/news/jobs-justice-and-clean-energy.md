**Hot Topic: Turbocharged.** President Biden introduced the American Jobs Plan on Wednesday in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a city known for its industrial past, setting the nation’s course toward a clean energy future. The historic and long-awaited $2 trillion infrastructure plan proposes an economy with the transition to a net-zero future at its core—not as an added benefit, but rather the way through which we will pursue a healthier and more equitable nation. Among other things, the budget proposal:


* Commits $180 billion in funding for research and development, with a focus on clean energy technology to reduce emissions and build climate resiliency;
* Earmarks $174 billion to build out a network of at least 500,000 EV charging stations across the country;
* Sets aside $100 billion to modernize the U.S. electrical grid and extend tax credits for renewable energy projects;
* Underscores the administration’s commitment to environmental justice by pledging $16 billion to plug old oil and gas wells and abandoned coal and uranium mines that disproportionately impact low-income communities and communities of color;
* Places an emphasis on job creation through green industry, like the production of batteries and parts for electric vehicles; and
* Calls for the creation of a Civilian Climate Corps, which would institute an estimated 20,000 environmental resiliency jobs annually.


Elevating these climate priorities counters Republican critiques that a transition to clean energy will result in massive job losses and a hit to the national economy. The plan’s emphasis on boosting industrial strength through the creation and acceleration of new American industries also counters GOP arguments that ending the fossil-fuel era will make the U.S. less competitive globally.


However, with Democrats holding the narrowest possible majority in the Senate, the plan’s path to approval may prove challenging. Already, Republican lawmakers are sounding the alarm over President Biden’s proposal to raise corporate taxes to pay the plan’s $2.3 trillion price tag and labeling its investments in climate action as extraneous.


Regardless, President Biden’s American Jobs Plan is the biggest step yet toward achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 while investing in America’s future.
