**Hot Topic: Climate extremes.** On the heels of record-setting temperatures that ravaged parts of the Western U.S., an unprecedented heat wave overwhelmed the Pacific Northwest and Western Canada this week. Officials have reported a staggering 586 sudden deaths as a direct result of the heat—nearly all of which are attributable to hyperthermia, heatstroke, heat exhaustion or dehydration. Hospitals in the region are also seeing a record number of emergency visits; the city of Seattle reported nearly 700 heat-related emergency room visits last Monday alone.


Scientists confirm that the intensity and frequency of heat waves are being exacerbated by planet-warming emissions. Just two decades ago, researchers openly hesitated to link extreme heat to climate change in any way, but now they say the burden of proof is on scientists to prove that human-induced climate change does *not* play a role.


And blazing heat is not the only extreme climate impact to wallop the U.S. in recent days. Severe storms battered the Detroit area over the weekend, inundating the city with seven inches of rain in just five hours, causing flash floods that damaged major highways and flooded homes and businesses.


Despite the extremes that continue to take human lives, ExxonMobil and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce were both in the hot seat this week for their efforts to undermine climate science. A senior director of federal relations for ExxonMobil was recorded describing the company’s efforts to thwart President Biden’s climate goals and fund “shadow groups” to work against climate science. And an investigation into the U.S. Chamber of Commerce found that the organization has been “a central actor in the national and global countermovement against ambitious action on climate change,”  with ties to several major campaigns to stop national and international climate policies. If we are to protect the well-being of the Earth and its people, urgent and significant actions from government and corporate leaders must replace the climate-denying efforts of major organizations that put the future of the planet in peril for the sake of profit.

#### Kicker


**Fact:** Did you know that Americans start a reported 19,500 fires each year from [fireworks](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/mailchimp.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f2f8c4bdabe1a2a83f914e813&id=17660ed985&e=17c77271a8__;!!HhhKMSGjjQV-!ocxbs7q7Gi1dXNcsR5YJG6_RijedJlV5L7zYuW1p3PszBQzjD1pRxWOB7rTKPXnZ%24)? With much of the country in drought and wildfire risk exceptionally high, please be mindful and safe this weekend!
