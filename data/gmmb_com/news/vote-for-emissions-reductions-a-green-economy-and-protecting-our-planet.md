Hot Topic: Eleven days. This Election Day, the stakes are higher than ever to ensure the protection of our planet and a healthy future for all. November 3—and every day until then, as Americans vote early and mail in their ballots—will be an opportunity to correct the Trump administration’s trajectory towards climate catastrophe. The choice is clear. While Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden’s environmental platform prioritizes reducing emissions and transitioning to a clean energy economy, the Trump administration has spent the last three and a half years systematically dismantling our environmental protections.
But don’t take our word for it. This week, The New York Times and The Guardian both published summaries of Mr. Trump’s 99 environmental rollbacks. Despite his claim during last night’s debate that “we have the cleanest air, the cleanest water and the best carbon emission standards,” Trump’s assault on the environment has moved us in exactly the opposite direction. A sampling of his actions include the following:
Withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement, which would commit the U.S. to help limit global heating to 2°C above pre-industrial temperatures;
Revoking or relaxing more than 20 rules implemented by previous administrations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and pollution;
Refusing to strengthen air pollution standards to protect against small particulate matter, which is associated with chronic bronchitis, reduced lung function, and increased death rates from lung cancer and heart disease;
Repealing rules to phase out hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), a major greenhouse gas used in refrigeration, air conditioning and building insulation, thereby increasing emissions by the equivalent of 2.9 million tons per year;
Allowing agencies undertaking federal infrastructure projects to evade accounting for the impact of those projects on the environment and climate change;
Scaling back Clean Water Act regulations for wetlands and tributaries, and allowing coal plants to discharge toxic waste into nearby waterways;
Allowing oil and gas development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, the last remaining stretch of true wilderness in the United States;
Disregarding environmental and health concerns to approve construction of the controversial Dakota Access pipeline; and
Continuing to disregard and devalue climate science despite the extreme weather events now putting every region of the country at risk.
Of course, the consequences of climate change are only exacerbated by these actions, and the results are already being felt around the globe and here in the U.S, where wildfires, hurricanes, heatwaves and droughts have all shattered records in 2020.
In contrast to Mr. Trump, Democratic candidate Joe Biden’s climate plan—the most ambitious ever proposed by a major U.S. presidential candidate—would transition America to a clean-energy economy and prioritize the emissions reductions that are now critical to the protection of the planet. There has simply never been a more important time for all of us to make our votes count.
