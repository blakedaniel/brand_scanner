**Hot Topic:** **Rich vs. poor.** New research out this week reveals the disproportionate role of the world’s rich in exacerbating the climate crisis. A report exploring the link between income levels and carbon footprints made the stunning finding that the top *one* percent of earners globally (52 million people) produces *double* the carbon emissions of the poorest *50* percent (4 billion people). Put another way, one rich person has the approximate carbon footprint of 154 poor people, a fact that is largely due to carbon-intensive lifestyle choices among the wealthy such as air travel, heavy automobiles, large, energy-inefficient homes and frequent beef and dairy consumption.


Unfortunately, the people least likely to exacerbate the climate crisis are the most likely to suffer its worst impacts—while the industries that fuel these disparities are often the loudest voices against a low-carbon transition. In just one example, a new NYU report found that since 2000, meat and dairy companies have spent more than $200 million lobbying against climate policies—including the Clean Air Act—and funding research specifically designed to mislead the public about their environmental impact.


While polluting industries spend vast sums to protect their interests in the face of an undeniable climate crisis, news this week continues to show that humans are simply expected to play the hand they are dealt. Low-income communities face housing policies that vastly increase their exposure to toxic air pollution. Twenty states have already or are currently attempting to criminalize peaceful fossil fuel protests, marginalizing the very communities whose land and health are most directly impacted. And a recent study of 1200 young adults 14-24 found that 83 percent are worried about the health of the planet, and 75 percent think that fact is impacting their mental health.


Moving forward, economic and public health disparities fueled by climate change will truly be addressed only when government and corporate leaders embrace an equitable and transparent transition to a low-carbon future.
