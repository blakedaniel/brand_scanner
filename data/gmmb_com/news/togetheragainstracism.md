 #Together​Against​Racism
========================


June 4, 2020

The country is at a boiling point. The horror of another black man dying before our eyes captured on video. A jogger getting killed because he was black. A black birdwatcher being falsely accused of attacking a woman in Central Park. The anger and pain can’t be ignored. The call for justice is pulsing through our cities.


GMMBers — like many people across the country — feel helpless, heartbroken and frustrated. We strive every day to do more. This initiative marks a strong commitment that we’re working toward solutions to systemic racism everywhere in all forms. We’re calling on everyone, from clients to friends and family, to join us in fighting to support racial justice. It is time to do more than march, post or talk about it. It is time to be part of the solution, part of the healing.


GMMB launched the **#TogetherAgainstRacism** campaign to raise funds for [**Color of Change**,](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/color-of-change-education-fund-1?refcode=GMMB&amount=25,100,250,1000,Other&recurring=1) [**Equal Justice Initiative**](https://eji.org/) and [**National Urban League**](https://nul.org/donate-gmmb), organizations on the front lines working for racial justice.  All donations from GMMB staff will be further increased through the firm’s matching contributions policy. We call on fellow communications agencies and advocacy organizations to join our efforts and encourage their employees to donate to these three organizations with a matching contributions policy.


Together, let’s create real and lasting change.

**Not sure if your company has a matching program?** 


Many employers sponsor charitable donation matching programs. Requesting a matching donation is a process that must be initiated by the donor, through completion and submission of a paper or electronic form provided by the employer.


To find out if your employer has a donation matching policy, contact your human resources department.
