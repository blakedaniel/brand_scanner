Hot Topic: Moving forward. In the six days since being declared president-elect, Joe Biden set his climate plans into motion, naming several climate-minded officials to his transition team and committing to embed climate experts across all federal departments and agencies under his administration. The president-elect also discussed tackling climate change in diplomatic talks with leaders from Britain, France, Germany and Ireland, establishing it as both a national priority and an opportunity to show international leadership.
Despite this, his incoming administration faces an uphill battle for enacting sweeping climate legislation. Biden has committed to rejoining the Paris Agreement—which the U.S. formally exited on November 4—on his first day in office. However, even if the U.S. recommits to reducing emissions by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 on January 20, the past four years of climate inaction under the Trump administration have left the U.S. far behind on its initial target.
Additionally, rejoining the Paris Agreement would require the U.S. to set national voluntary emissions reduction policies and goals, a feat that may prove impossible under a Republican-controlled Senate. Two Senate runoff elections in Georgia on January 5 will determine the majority party, with a Republican-run Senate possible if they secure just one seat.
Fortunately, Biden can pursue climate action regardless of Congressional support. His administration can undo virtually all Trump-era rollbacks on protections for the country’s air, waterways and land. He can elevate climate change as a priority by appointing agency officials with strong, science-based climate backgrounds. He can leverage existing Republican support to phase out the use of hydrofluorocarbons, planet-warming chemicals widely used in air conditioners and refrigerants. And, as called for by many environmental activists supporting the president-elect, Biden can create a new National Climate Council to support pro-climate decision-making across the federal government.
After four long years of environmental rollbacks and climate denial, last Tuesday’s election brought the country one step closer to turning the corner towards a brighter future for the planet and its people.
