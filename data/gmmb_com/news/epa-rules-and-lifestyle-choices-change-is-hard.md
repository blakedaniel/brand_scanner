**Hot Topic: Tough choices.** The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed ambitious new emissions limits on U.S. power plants this week—a decisive and important move that could take a sizable bite out of harmful U.S. greenhouse gas emissions if adopted. Predictably, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and congressional Republicans raged against the proposed rules, which will face a contentious legal battle from Republican attorneys general and legislative challenges from GOP lawmakers in the weeks ahead.


As climate battles rage in Washington, similar struggles are taking place on an individual level around the world as awareness about climate change clashes head-on with ingrained lifestyle choices. Several recent reports on individual behavior change in the face of the climate crisis reveal both challenges and opportunities.


In Europe, a study found that a majority of citizens in the seven countries surveyed are concerned about climate change and want more aggressive action to solve it. However, most are reluctant or unwilling to take personal steps to reduce their carbon footprints if doing so would have a measurable impact their lifestyles, such as buying only secondhand clothes or eliminating meat from their diets.


Another study that scored American adults on their likelihood to make sustainable purchasing choices found that women, people of color, city dwellers and people aged 18-39 are the most likely to buy sustainably. Lagging behind them—in some cases by frustratingly wide margins—are men, suburban and rural residents, whites, and people 40 and older.


And a third study out of Australia helps to explain part of that gap, finding that many men who personally identify as masculine may resist making the switch to a vegetarian diet because eating meat makes them feel more “manly,” while eliminating it would threaten their masculinity.


The results of these studies highlight the innate challenge to broader society: Even small changes are easier said than done, particularly in the face of ingrained cultural norms. And the battles in Washington show that even common-sense emission reductions that will limit pollution, improve air quality and help tackle the climate crisis are never a given, particularly in our polarized society. There is no question that change is hard at any scale, but with so much at stake, change has never been more necessary—and it will pay dividends to humanity for lifetimes to come.
