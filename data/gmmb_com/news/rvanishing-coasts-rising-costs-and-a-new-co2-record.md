***The Climate, Health & Equity Brief is GMMB’s take on the week’s news on the current impacts of climate change. If you haven’t subscribed yet, you can do so by [clicking here](https://mailchimp.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=f2f8c4bdabe1a2a83f914e813&id=4a13a601e2).***


**Hot Topic:** **Africa in focus.** Several new reports out this week highlight the brutal climate inequities between rich and poor nations, starting with the disastrous impacts of sea level rise.


Approximately 200 million people around the globe could be uprooted by 2050 due to shoreline erosion and flooding, according to the UN—and the problem is particularly acute in West Africa, where 80 percent of the population lives along the Atlantic coast. In Senegal, rising sea levels are already eroding the coast at a shocking rate of 10 feet per year, forcing thousands in seaside communities to abandon their vibrant, bustling communities and relocate to barren displacement camps several miles inland.


And disproportionate climate impacts don’t stop with Africa’s vanishing coasts. Intense heat, crippling drought and extreme weather all threaten hundreds of millions of people on the continent, and a new report out this week shows just how far short donor nations are falling in keeping pace with climate-fueled humanitarian need.  According to a report from Oxfam, the UN must now provide an average of $15.5 billion in aid each year due to extreme weather events alone—an annual increase of more than 800% since 2002.  Despite this, wealthy nations whose vast economic growth has fueled the climate crisis are contributing only half of the humanitarian aid required to meet the need.


Despite mounting evidence of human suffering around the world as the climate crisis intensifies, NOAA shared some grim statistics this week. The amount of planet-warming carbon dioxide in the atmosphere broke a record in May and is now at the highest point in at least 4 million years. And despite lots of rhetoric and some real action from governments to mitigate climate change, humans still pumped 36 billion tons of the planet-warming gas into the atmosphere in 2021, more than in any previous year.

#### Equity



Experts warn that only 22% of weather stations in Africa meet global climate observing system reporting requirements and the lack of extreme weather monitoring and [warning systems](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa-needs-better-weather-warning-systems-urge-experts/2022/06/06/3e50eaa8-e5a0-11ec-a422-11bbb91db30b_story.html) on the continent is putting Africans at risk and creating critical gaps in global climate data. (The Washington Post)


Despite a startling new [report](https://oxfamilibrary.openrepository.com/bitstream/handle/10546/621382/bp-fair-finance-loss-and-damage-070622-en.pdf "https://oxfamilibrary.openrepository.com/bitstream/handle/10546/621382/bp-fair-finance-loss-and-damage-070622-en.pdf") which finds that the climate crisis has increased [humanitarian aid costs](https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/07/world/climate-emergencies-funds-un-report-intl-hnk/index.html "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/07/world/climate-emergencies-funds-un-report-intl-hnk/index.html") by 800%, wealthy donor nations—who are also the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitters—are only providing half of what is needed to address climate-fueled disasters. (CNN)


Scientists warn that up to [86 million residents](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2022/senegal-climate-refugee-crisis/ "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2022/senegal-climate-refugee-crisis/") in sub-Saharan Africa could be forced from their homes by 2050 due to extreme climate impacts, and Saint-Louis, Senegal—among Africa’s most vulnerable cities—is at risk of being 80 percent underwater in less than 60 years.
