**Hot Topic: Evidence.**Venice captured global headlines this week as surging sea waters inundated the historic city, flooding major tourist destinations and causing hundreds of millions of euros’ worth of damage. In one ironic twist to the tragedy, the Regional Council of Veneto flooded for the first time in its history just moments after it rejected several key measures to combat climate change.


Garnering less attention this week were several striking studies on the toll climate change is taking on human health.  One finds a correlation between rising temperatures and suicide rates, even among those already accustomed to hot weather. A second links air pollution and the risk of brain cancer for the first time.  And a third sounds the alarm that children born today face a future in which their health will be negatively affected at every single stage of their life by a changing climate.


Finally, financial experts are speaking out. the Federal Reserve warned that climate change has the power to destroy wealth, exacerbate income inequality, displace communities permanently, cause price and market instability and jeopardize the soundness of the entire U.S. banking system.  And the traditionally climate change-doubting U.S. Chamber of Commerce has issued a stunning about-face, calling for the U.S. to stay in the Paris Agreement—and stating that climate inaction is “not an option.”  President Trump, are you listening?
