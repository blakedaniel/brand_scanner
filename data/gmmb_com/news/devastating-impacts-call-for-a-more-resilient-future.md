**Hot Topic:** **Building resilience.** Hurricane Ian is tied for 5th strongest storm ever to hit the contiguous United States. It’s one of the deadliest storms in Florida’s history, it has claimed at least 115 lives, and its costs are projected to soar past $60 billion. Thousands of people remain displaced, the clean-up alone is projected to take months, and questions of how—and even whether—to rebuild devastated coastal communities in the face of climate change have become the subject of debate.


On his visit to survey damages in Florida, President Biden declared that events like Hurricane Ian have “put an end” to the question of whether climate change exists as Florida Governor and GOP presidential hopeful Ron DeSantis looked on. DeSantis—whose residents now require hundreds of millions of dollars in federal aid—signed legislation last year that *bans* Florida cities and towns from adopting 100 percent clean energy goals, reasoning that those goals “discriminate” against fossil fuels—the very cause of the climate crisis.


President Biden also visited Puerto Rico this week to survey damage in the wake of last month’s Hurricane Fiona, which killed 25 people and wiped out all power to the island.  He underscored the importance of rebuilding with a focus on resilience to future disasters—and promised that the island would see “every dollar” of the federal government’s pledge of $60 million to aid recovery.


How should America rebuild in the wake of such massive destruction?  One small Florida town may hold the key. Enter Babcock Ranch, a town of 5,000 just 12 miles northeast of hard-hit Fort Myers.  Established in 2018, it is America’s first 100% solar-powered town. It is surrounded by preserved land, all power lines to homes run underground for protection from high winds, and its streets are specifically designed to absorb floodwaters. And so far, it’s working—the town sustained *zero* power outages, flooding, or major structural damage from Hurricane Ian.

#### Human Health



Hurricane Ian is [confirmed](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/weather/hurricane/article266915356.html "https://www.miamiherald.com/news/weather/hurricane/article266915356.html") to have killed at least 115 people ranging in age from 19 to 96 across 15 counties in Florida, with causes of death including drowning, head trauma, heart attack, suffocation due to loss of power to oxygen machines, and post-storm suicide—with more expected fatalities still to be confirmed. (Miami Herald)



#### Planetary Health


The [Nord Stream](https://www.npr.org/2022/10/04/1126562195/the-nord-stream-pipelines-have-stopped-leaking-but-the-methane-emitted-broke-rec) pipelines—which run under the Baltic Sea to deliver natural gas from Russia to Germany—are strongly suspected of being deliberately [sabotaged](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/06/world/europe/nord-stream-pipeline-leaks-sweden.html), resulting in multiple leaks that emitted up to 400,000 tons of methane in what is estimated to be the largest single methane release ever. (NPR, The New York Times)


Hurricane Ian is providing key [climate lessons](https://insideclimatenews.org/todaysclimate/6-unexpected-climate-lessons-from-hurricane-ian/) that show how warming temperatures can make winds stronger, clouds denser, storm surges more extreme and hurricanes much wetter and slower, compounding threats to result in life-threatening conditions for coastal communities around the globe.

#### Equity




Climate disasters like Hurricane Ian are increasing racial and wealth inequality, with [insurance claims and FEMA aid](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/hurricane-ian-damage-recovery-fema-make-wealth-disparities-worse-rcna50226) disproportionately helping wealthier, whiter communities while leaving nonwhite communities at greater risk of foreclosure. (NBC News)


Indigenous Alaskan coastal communities are losing their generations-old harvest practices as warmer temperatures and power outages wipe out their traditional [cold storage](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/04/dining/climate-change-freezers-alaska-natives.html#:~:text=the%20main%20story-,Climate%20Change%20Comes%20for%20the%20Freezers%2C%20a%20Key%20Tool%20for,store%20their%20traditional%20subsistence%20foods.) methods, placing their winter harvests at risk. (The New York Times)


A new [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264275122004309?via%3Dihub) reveals how wealthier homebuyers and developers in Florida are pushing low-income communities out of areas less vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and provides a new [Climate Gentrification Risk Index](https://www.eenews.net/thank-you-article-2/) to help policymakers recognize and respond to climate gentrification.
