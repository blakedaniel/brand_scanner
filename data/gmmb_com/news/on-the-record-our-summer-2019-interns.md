 On the Record: Our Summer 2019 Interns
======================================


August 30, 2019

Our seven summer interns spent the last 10 weeks with us to create real and lasting change. They deep dived into communications, and made plenty of memories along the way. They have a lot to share. So before they leave the GMMB family, we asked them to tell us about themselves and their experiences:

**Hometown**: Valencia, California.

**College/University**: Cornell University.

**Team**: Global and Domestic Health Team/DC.
**Most memorable account/project that you worked on**: The “I Heart Caregivers” campaign for AARP. Listening to and reading people’s stories about caring for their loved ones is simultaneously heartbreaking and eye-opening. It is the perfect example of how our work, and AARP’s work, can ease people’s lives in a very intimate and meaningful way.
**Favorite book/movie/show you’ve read/seen recently**: When Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanithi. It’s a memoir that is both beautifully and brutally written by a young, recently married doctor with terminal cancer.
**Favorite lunch spot near the office**: Bangkok Joe’s has been so clutch and has fed me through busy times, rainy days and Asian fusion cravings. Every time I grab lunch there, I end up having leftovers for dinner, which as a perennially broke college student, getting two meals for the price of one is all I ask for.

**Hometown**: Washington, D.C.
**College/University**: Washington University in St. Louis.
**Team**: Creative.
**Most memorable account/project that you worked on**: An infographic for The Gates Foundation in collaboration with Baltimore City Public Schools. While creating this infographic, I was involved in every step of the process, from attending the initial brainstorming meeting to designing each element and presenting the sketches internally.
**Three Instagram pages everybody should follow**:
@sydwiki: Sydney Hanson is an amazing illustrator who creates whimsical images of animals and nature. 
@simply.cool.design: A unique page to follow because they post an array of artists who have interesting and original work. 
@natgeo: Features intriguing imagery and information from scientists and educators around the world.
**Any particular advice from a fellow GMMBer that has stuck with you**: Senior Art Director Scott Margolis told me that “you can never ask too many questions” and “if you don’t know how to do something, you should always ask.” This has been valuable advice because it has empowered me to learn new skills. By asking questions, I have learned from the designers how to utilize design programs in new ways.



### Sydney Lykins

**Hometown**: Reno, Nevada.
**College/University**: College of William & Mary.
**Team**: Brand and Social Impact Team/DC.
**Favorite book/movie/show you’ve read/seen recently**: Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman—this book describes the two pathways of the mind (one prone to snap decisions and one prone to complex decision-making) and the resulting biases. While it definitely appealed to my psychology nerd side, it is also very applicable to the field of communications! 
**Any particular advice from a fellow GMMBer that has stuck with you**: Account Supervisor Eric Conrad has given me so much great advice over the summer, especially in regards to working on a team—he said, “while you may have your disagreements with your team internally, when you are facing a client or other external forces you should always have each other’s back.“
**If your life had a theme song, what would it be**: Don’t Think Twice, It’s Alright by Bob Dylan. Because I’ve found that things really do work out!



### Alexis Salcedo

**Hometown**: Bethesda, Maryland.
**College/University**: Duke University.
**Team**: Brand and Social Impact Team/DC.
**Favorite “Only at GMMB” moment**: Meeting Kamala Harris!
**Any particular advice from a fellow GMMBer that has stuck with you**: Assistant Account Executive Ivonne Rodriguez told me to “talk to as many people as you can. But don’t think about it as networking, think about it as developing real, long-lasting relationships.” Also, take advantage of the free seltzer!
**Favorite lunch spot near the office:** Falafel Inc.



### Evan Curry

**Hometown**: Seattle, Washington.
**College/University**: Washington State University. Go Cougs!
**Team**: Brand and Social Impact Team/Seattle.
**Most memorable account/project that you worked on**: My work with the Gates Education account—researching content and drafting social media content.
**Favorite “Only at GMMB” moment**: At the end of a Friday after an exhausting week, it took me and another GMMB member nearly 10 minutes and many attempts to count 44 boxes.
**If your life had a theme song, what would it be**: Antisocial by Ed Sheeran featuring Travis Scott.



### Madeleine Mullins

**Hometown**: Seattle, Washington.
**School**: I’m going to be a senior at Ballard High School.
**Team**: Brand and Social Impact Team/Seattle.
**Favorite book/movie/show you’ve read/seen recently**: The book Educated by Tara Westover.
**Any particular advice from a fellow GMMBer that has stuck with you**: One of the interns from last year told me to just put myself out there and try everything. I think that’s really important, especially for a high school student who is here to learn as much as possible.
**If your life had a theme song, what would it be**: A Place In This World by Taylor Swift.
