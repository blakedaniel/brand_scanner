**Hot Topic: Dystopia.**From the beaches of Maui to the mountain towns of Alaska to the bustling metropolis of Beijing, increasingly extreme weather continues to ravage cities around the globe.


July registered as the hottest month ever recorded on the planet, and intense hurricanes, out-of-control wildfires, devastating floods and omnipresent sea-level rise are increasingly becoming the new normal. The horrific, near-complete wildfire destruction of historic Lahaina—a popular island tourist destination in the middle of the Pacific Ocean—exemplifies the shocking and life-threatening challenges now being faced by communities around the globe, many of which don’t even make news in the United States.


With disasters striking more frequently and with greater intensity, emergency relief funds and insurance companies are at their limit. FEMA’s disaster relief fund is on pace to run out of money this month—before this year’s peak hurricane and wildfire seasons. A new report revealed that 90% of natural disaster-driven losses in Europe during the first half of 2023 had zero insurance protection. And in the U.S., just 60% of the $165 billion in 2020 climate-related economic losses were covered by insurance. Coupled with the fact that several insurance companies have stopped offering or renewing homeowner insurance policies in states like California and Florida, the climate crisis is translating into economic hardship—even the threat of financial ruin—for millions.


Ironically, the impacts of climate change are making it even harder to fight its causes. U.S. solar and wind energy projects face higher property insurance premiums of up to 50%, threatening to hinder the transition to cleaner energy sources. And insurance companies have a conflict of interest. A new report found that the U.S. insurance sector held $536 billion in fossil-fuel-related assets in 2019, despite insurers often citing climate-related risk as a factor in raising premiums and dropping coverage within high-risk regions.


Even with Americans in all 50 states at risk of climate-related disasters and related financial risk, Republicans have doubled down on their climate denial and set their sights on spreading misinformation to kids. Former Gov. Mike Huckabee (R-AR) has released a new children’s book, “The Kids Guide to the Truth About Climate Change,” that minimizes the role of human emissions on the climate. And Florida—undoubtedly one of the U.S. states most at risk of deadly climate impacts—has approved videos for use in K-5 classrooms that compare climate activists to Nazis, claim that wind and solar power pollute the planet, and dismiss record heat waves as natural weather variations.

[Catastrophic wildfires](https://mailchimp.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f2f8c4bdabe1a2a83f914e813&id=0697d9ed1a&e=b1bd18d53b) fueled by strong [hurricane winds](https://mailchimp.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=f2f8c4bdabe1a2a83f914e813&id=73992cdfb5&e=b1bd18d53b) destroyed popular and historic Lahaina town in Maui, killing at least 96 people, destroying hundreds of homes and businesses, leaving more than 1,000 people missing, and knocking out power, internet and radio communications as other fires continue to rage across the island.
