**Hot Topic: Progress.** There’s no denying that the climate crisis is happening, and more news every week shows just how impactful it is. But as we head into 2020, we wanted to take a few moments to reflect on the progress that was made in 2019 and the stories that give us hope for the future.


Despite federal attempts to weaken protections and a stalemate on some of the biggest issues at COP25, new innovations have accelerated progress and laid the groundwork for major advances in the years to come. Governments across the country and around the world have passed policies to mitigate the impact of a changing climate. And dozens of major corporations have stepped up to show leadership and do their fair share.


Science has told us that negative health impacts of air pollution can be reversed and shed light on the best ways to leverage technology to reduce health impacts and increase equitable prosperity. And people around to world—led by the youngest among us—are organizing, speaking out and holding our leaders accountable. Climate change is the biggest planetary crisis we face, but these advances and move give us hope that real change is on the horizon. We look forward to continuing the fight with you all in 2020.


– Matt & Traci, GMMB
