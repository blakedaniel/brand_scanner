 Young people fight back

**Hot Topic: Emerging voices.** As extreme weather goes into overdrive around the world, young people are emerging on the front lines of climate activism and making their presence known in the courts.


This month, a group of young people aged 5-22 won its first-in-the-nation case against the state of Montana, arguing that the state has failed to uphold the state constitution’s guarantee of a right to a “clean and healthful” environment. The decision affirmed that claim and struck down provisions in the Montana Environmental Policy Act that barred the state from considering climate impacts when permitting energy projects. Despite its certain appeal by the fossil fuel industry, *Held v. Montana* has been hailed by experts as a major victory and one of the strongest decisions issued by a court to date on climate change.


And a second youth-led lawsuit is now headed to trial next summer. On the heels of the catastrophic climate-fueled devastation on Maui, a judge in Hawaii has approved a lawsuit filed by 14 young people aged 10-20—most of whom are Indigenous youth. The suit claims the state Department of Transportation prioritizes projects like highway construction that “lock in and escalate the use of fossil fuels, rather than projects that mitigate and reduce emissions.”


Unsurprisingly, oil companies like Shell and ExxonMobil, seeing the writing on the wall as youth climate activism gains steam, are partnering with PR firms and social media influencers to gain the trust of younger people, employing greenwashing tactics that further divert attention from the environmental impact of fossil fuels. Let the games begin.
