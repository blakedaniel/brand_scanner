Climate, Health and Equity Brief House Votes to Build Back Better

The Climate, Health & Equity Brief is GMMB’s take on the week’s news on the current impacts of climate change. If you haven’t subscribed yet, you can do so by clicking here.
Hot Topic: Investment. The U.S. took two major steps forward on tackling the climate crisis this week. On Monday, President Biden signed into law the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill that included the nation’s largest-ever investment in climate change mitigation and environmental justice initiatives. And today, the House passed the follow-on $2 trillion Build Back Better Act, which allocates an additional $550 billion in climate funding—including more than $300 billion in tax incentives to encourage companies and consumers to go green.
The measure makes critical investments in wildfire reduction, coastal resilience, alternative-fuel vehicles and clean energy technology research, and creates a Climate Conservation Corps that will employ hundreds of thousands of young people in efforts to restore carbon-capturing forests and wetlands. Notably, the bill also aims to raise more than $100 billion from fossil fuel companies—namely by closing a tax loophole, reinstating lapsed taxes, increasing fees for fossil fuel leases and placing a fee on methane leaks.
Analyses by independent experts underscore how significant this legislative action can be. Ultimate passage of the Build Back Better Act has the potential to reduce annual carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S. by about a sixth. However, the legislation faces an uncertain road ahead as it moves to the Senate, where it will require the full support of Democrats in the face of united opposition among Republicans.
