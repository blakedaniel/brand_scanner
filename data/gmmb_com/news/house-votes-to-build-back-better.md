**Hot Topic: Investment.** The U.S. took two major steps forward on tackling the climate crisis this week. On Monday, President Biden signed into law the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill that included the nation’s largest-ever investment in climate change mitigation and environmental justice initiatives. And today, the House passed the follow-on $2 trillion Build Back Better Act, which allocates an *additional* $550 billion in climate funding—including more than $300 billion in tax incentives to encourage companies and consumers to go green.


The measure makes critical investments in wildfire reduction, coastal resilience, alternative-fuel vehicles and clean energy technology research, and creates a Climate Conservation Corps that will employ hundreds of thousands of young people in efforts to restore carbon-capturing forests and wetlands. Notably, the bill also aims to raise more than $100 billion from fossil fuel companies—namely by closing a tax loophole, reinstating lapsed taxes, increasing fees for fossil fuel leases and placing a fee on methane leaks.


Analyses by independent experts underscore how significant this legislative action can be. Ultimate passage of the Build Back Better Act has the potential to reduce annual carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S. by about a sixth. However, the legislation faces an uncertain road ahead as it moves to the Senate, where it will require the full support of Democrats in the face of united opposition among Republicans.

New [research](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/46/e2104061118) found that keeping global temperature increases under 2°C (3.6°F) through the end of the century would prevent 4.5 million [premature deaths](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/esnt/2021/reducing-emissions-to-mitigate-climate-change-could-yield-dramatic-health-benefits-by-2030), 1.4 million hospitalizations and emergency room visits, and 1.7 million incidences of dementia.

A new [investigation](https://www.ehn.org/mental-health-2655533166/what-we-found) revealed that air and water pollution in western Pennsylvania is having strongly correlated mental health impacts, [altering](https://www.ehn.org/air-pollution-mental-illness-2655532520.html) cerebral functions and leading to further mental illnesses, particularly among children and communities of color in the region.

#### Politics & Economy


House Democrats passed President Biden’s $2 trillion [Build Back Better spending package](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/11/19/house-spending-reconciliation-bill) Friday morning*—*including more than $550 billion in funding for climate mitigation, green energy promotion and EV incentives*—*but the bill now faces a difficult path in the Senate. (The Washington Post)


The $1.2 trillion [bipartisan infrastructure bill](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/15/biden-signs-infrastructure-bill-how-it-fights-climate-change.html) signed by President Biden on Monday designates $50 billion for climate resilience, $65 billion for clean energy and grid investments, and $7.5 billion for EV charging stations nationwide.

New polling shows that the percentage of Americans who believe climate change to be a [serious problem](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/11/12/strong-winds-climate-change-have-failed-move-opinions-many-americans/) remains largely unchanged in the past six years while the climate crisis has worsened, but the partisan divide on the issue has widened.

Due to a legal setback, the federal government launched an auction for the [largest-ever sale](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/17/biden-administration-gulf-of-mexico-oil-gas-drilling-leases) of oil and gas drilling leases in the Gulf of Mexico, outraging many who say the Biden administration is damaging US credibility on climate and going back on his own executive order to put an end to offshore drilling.  (The Guardian)
