Hot Topic: Economics.  The increasing economic impact of the climate crisis continues to percolate in countries large and small. In the U.S., research released Monday has found that U.S. banks are protecting themselves from climate change by shifting riskier mortgages, such as those in coastal areas, off their books and over to the federal government, effectively transferring the financial risk to U.S. taxpayers.
In India, the annual monsoon season has overrun by almost a month, bringing 37% more rainfall than normal, causing deaths from collapsing buildings, and causing many vital crops to rot. For consumers, the impact of the late-receding monsoon has meant a steep rise in the price of onions, an essential ingredient in Indian food, which are now selling for four times their normal price.
And a cluster of nine small island nations in the Pacific, led by Nauru, are warning of the potential for ‘economic Armageddon’ as they face the dual threat of sea-level rise and the destruction it would bring to the tuna fishing industry, which serves as the engine of their economies through the $6 billion it brings annually to the islands.
How will history remember the leaders who refused urgent action despite emissions-as-usual threatening investments, livelihoods and entire economies around the globe?
