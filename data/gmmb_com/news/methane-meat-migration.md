**Hot Topic:** **Food for thought.** President Biden announced Friday that the United States and Europe will work to cut global methane emissions by a third by 2030—an “ambitious but achievable” goal the U.S. has also pledged to help developing countries meet. The announcement came as Climate Week is set to kick off Monday in New York City, and six weeks before world leaders will gather in Glasgow for COP26, the UN climate change conference at which countries update their plans for reducing emissions.


The need for action from world leaders in Glasgow is urgent. Greenhouse gas emissions are currently poised to grow by 16 percent this decade, even as scientists indicate that they must decrease by at least 25 percent by 2030 to avert the worst impacts of climate change. U.S. climate envoy John Kerry calls this year’s COP26 meeting “the last, best chance the world has” to turn the tide.


For these reasons and more, President Biden’s methane announcement comes at a critical time.  A new report found that the combined annual greenhouse gas emissions from just five meat and dairy companies equal that of oil and gas giant ExxonMobil, and that the top 20 livestock producers emit more greenhouse gases annually than Germany, Britain or France. The process to raise livestock is carbon-, land- and water-intensive, and agricultural activities including raising livestock, producing feed and cultivating crops are together responsible for an estimated 14.5 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.  Methane makes up an estimated 56-58 percent of agricultural emissions—and while methane only stays in the atmosphere for approximately a decade, its ability to trap heat in the atmosphere during that time is 21 times greater than that of CO2.


Another new food-related report out this week highlights the expected, climate-fueled global loss of staple crops—including wheat, rice and soy—and predicts that almost one-third of the world’s cropland will be exposed to severe drought for at least three months each year by 2050. This scenario is particularly troubling given that population growth is projected to fuel a 50-75 percent increase in global food demand during the same time frame. Projected crop decline is one of the reasons the World Bank now predicts that climate change could displace 200 million people and force massive global migration shifts by 2050.


From livestock to crops, ensuring food security for future generations requires significant emissions reductions from the agricultural sector. Controversial as the topic may be to some, scientists agree that one of the most impactful ways to reduce emissions across the agricultural industry—as well as to improve human health—is to adopt more plant-based diets. While climate action by the highest global emitters—governments and businesses—will take center stage in the weeks ahead, this is one way we can take action in our own lives to feed our convictions while feeding ourselves.
