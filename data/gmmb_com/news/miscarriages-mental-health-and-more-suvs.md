Hot Topic: Human health.  There has been no shortage of new research this week on the toll climate change is already taking on our health.  Researchers in China have found an alarming link between maternal exposure to air pollution and the risk of miscarriage. A new study predicts that warming temperatures will help Ebola spread faster and reach new regions of the world. And researchers have raised the alarm about the mental health toll the ecological crisis is taking on scientists, calling on academic institutions to support them with mental health services akin to those provided to first responders or the military.
Meanwhile, Japan endured one of the most devastating typhoons in its history, leaving nearly 100 people dead, thousands homeless, hundreds of thousands of households without power or water, and an estimated $9 billion in damage. Unfortunately, climate scientists predict that these voracious storms are only going to increase as the climate crisis intensifies.
As scientists warn that the climate crisis could “halt and reverse” progress made in human health over the past century, a new study reveals the 91 organizations that together provide $1 billion annually to keep the climate-denial industry going strong.  In the face of this, it is up to all of us to vote, speak out, buy sustainably and educate anyone around us who may still be in doubt.  On this latter point, we have included a great resource from the folks at Grist below to help do just that.
