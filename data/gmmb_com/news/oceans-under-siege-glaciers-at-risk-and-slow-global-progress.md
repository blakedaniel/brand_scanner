**Hot Topic: In hot water.**While the world was transfixed by the tragic voyage of the Titan submersible and the five lost souls on board this week, other deeply troubling ocean news flew a bit more below the collective radar.


First, an “exceptional” category 4 marine heat wave in the North Atlantic Ocean—defined as “extreme” by NOAA—is raising alarm among scientists. Temperatures up to 5°C (9°F) hotter than usual in some places are stressing a range of species vital to the ocean ecosystem, from fish and shellfish to algae, coral and ocean plant life. In addition to the immediate impacts, scientists also warn that increased ocean warming is likely to fuel more intense cyclones, atmospheric rivers, flooding events and sea level rise globally.


Yet another new report shows that the deepest waters of the Antarctic—which play a critical role in absorbing excess heat and carbon pollution—have warmed four times faster than the rest of the global ocean and shrunk by more than 20% over the past three decades due to reductions in sea ice formation. The resulting changes to deep-water circulation can have far-reaching consequences, including hampering carbon absorption, which limits the ocean’s ability to help mitigate climate change and its impacts.


Rising temperatures are also melting glaciers at an alarming rate. A new report found that glaciers across the Hindu Kush Himalayan range could lose up to 80% of their volume by the end century without significant emissions reductions. This result would trigger increased flash floods and avalanches and impede freshwater access for more than 2 billion people across 16 countries in Asia, many of which have contributed little in the way of global carbon emissions.


Despite clear planetary signals and dire warnings from scientists, global leaders struggled to achieve action and progress at two high-profile global climate convenings in recent days. At talks in Bonn and Paris, disagreements centered around just how much wealthy nations should financially support the developing countries now trying to grow their economies without the same reliance on fossil fuels, all while suffering the most severe climate impacts. One can’t overstate how much now hinges on the willingness of world leaders to take significant action at COP28, as the warnings from nature and humanity grow stronger with each passing day.
