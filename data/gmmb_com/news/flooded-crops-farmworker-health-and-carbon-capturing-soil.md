Hot topic of the week: Farmers. Climate change is proving to be a formidable challenge for the American farmer. A devastating storm season in the Midwest this spring has left vast areas of farmland underwater, delaying the normal planting schedule. Just 50 percent of Ohio’s corn crop and 32 percent of its soybean crop have been planted as of this week, prompting the state to seek a disaster declaration from the federal government. Scientists predict that the changing climate will continue to cause wetter storm seasons and longer and drier summers, creating a growing crisis for farmers.
And climate change isn’t only an economic danger for farmers—it’s also a health risk. Cases of valley fever, a lung infection caused by a soil-borne fungus, have grown among farmers in California, thanks to years of climate change-fueled droughts that have helped the fungus thrive. The expected increase in frequency and intensity of heatwaves will also have a disproportionate impact on farmers, laborers and others who work outside.
There are, however, promising advances in agriculture technology and techniques that can, in turn, help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. One company is even creating monetary incentives for farmers to adopt practices that reduce or remove carbon from the atmosphere, helping demonstrate one of the many ways we can—and must—shift practices in order to stave off the worst impacts of a heating planet.

Approximately 70 percent of the Indian Sundarbans is a few feet above sea level – putting many of the 13 million people who call the archipelago home at risk of becoming climate refugees, as they lose their land to coastal erosion, floods, and violent storms. (The Atlantic)
Politics & Economy
Unprecedented flooding in the Midwest has prevented the planting of major crops like soy and corn, putting farmers at high financial risk in a year when a record number of farms have already declared bankruptcy. (HuffPost)
Increased meat consumption, a growing population and changing weather patterns are forcing Midwest farmers to rethink their techniques so that we won’t have to choose between watering our crops and hydrating ourselves. (WIRED)
Action
A company is incentivizing farmers to use soil techniques that sequester carbon by connecting them to companies who want to reduce their own carbon footprint. (Fast Company)
Cost-effective electric vehicles are not as far away as many think, and the savings and benefits of transitioning away from gas-powered cars will ultimately far outweigh the costs. (Forbes)
