**Hot Topic: Dorian.**Hurricane Dorian’s ferocity has weakened since it struck the Bahamas, but its devastation to the island nation is being described in apocalyptic terms.


More than 13,000 homes have been destroyed, most of which are unlikely to be covered by insurance. With 70 percent of homes underwater, both the death toll and the health impacts on survivors are expected to rise sharply. And there has been catastrophic damage to the country’s infrastructure, making aid exceptionally difficult to deliver and the road to rebuilding uncertain.


The science connecting climate change to massive hurricanes like Dorian is strong. Despite this, the Trump administration has worked to roll back 84 regulations designed to curb emissions, protect our air and water, and fight climate change. The Pope has urged government leaders to take drastic action, and soon youth around the world will take to the streets demanding change.


As we brace for Dorian’s weakened yet still threatening presence in the Carolinas, now is a time to ask: what are each and every one of us doing to demand more from our leaders, and to help be a part of the climate solution?

**Health**  

A humanitarian crisis is unfolding in the Bahamas, with 70 percent of homes underwater, more than 60,000 people with [no food or clean drinking water](https://weather.com/news/news/2019-09-04-hurricane-dorian-bahamas-impacts-abaco-grand-bahama) and relief groups struggling to reach survivors. (The Weather Channel)


New research shows that exposure to extreme or even moderate weather events may result in ‘[psychological casualties](https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2019-09-05/hurricanes-like-dorian-take-heavy-toll-on-mental-health)‘ with significant impacts on mental health. (U.S. News)

The human population is expected to climb to 9.7 billion by midcentury, while [the global food supply](https://time.com/5663621/climate-change-food-supply/) is predicted to plummet due to climate change. (Time)


**Equity**  

As Dorian makes it way up the U.S. coast, the [cost of evacuation](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/hurricane-dorian-evacuations-only-people-block-who-left-have-money-n1048941) keeps many at home — even if that home is in the danger zone. (NBC)


[Women bear the brunt of extreme weather events](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/climate-change-disproportionately-affects-women-and-young-girls-and-here-s-why) such as drought, flooding, and disease outbreaks because they lack economic, political and legal power. (Relief Web)


**Politics & Economy**  

Of the estimated [130,000 homes wiped out](https://www.wsj.com/articles/dorian-is-exposing-an-insurance-gap-in-the-bahamas-11567538604) by Dorian, the ‘vast majority’ are unlikely to be covered by insurance. (Paywall: Wall Street Journal)


Because of climate change, [economically devastating mega-storms](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2019/09/03/heres-why-hurricane-dorian-is-moving-so-slowlyand-why-it-may-be-the-new-normal/#7db37d241181) could become our new normal. (Forbes)


The Trump administration has worked to [repeal 84 environmental regulations](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/29/climate/climate-rule-trump-reversing.html), unraveling efforts by previous administrations to protect our land, air and water, reduce emissions, and fight climate change. (The New York Times)


**Action**  

Pope Francis has urged governments and politicians to take [drastic measures](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-environment-pope/pope-urges-politicians-to-take-drastic-measures-on-climate-change-idUSKCN1VM161) to reduce the use of fossil fuels, saying the world is facing a climate emergency.
