The past few months have been an exciting time at GMMB, and our team of interns has been a big part of that. Since they came on board in September, our interns have been contributing their creative insight, research skills, strategic input and passion for good to the meaningful work GMMB tackles every day.


GMMB has a knack for hiring smart and talented people whose personalities are anything but cookie-cutter. Each of our 12 fall interns brought with them a unique perspective, so we were eager to hear their thoughts on what it’s like to cause the effect at our DC and Seattle offices. Here’s what they told us:

**Where is your favorite work spot in GMMB?** My desk, because it overlooks the Potomac and Northern Virginia. It goes from honey-yellow light over the water during the day to a dark cityscape at night.


**Was there a GMMBer whose position/story/career you found fascinating? What did you learn from them?** Kerry-Ann Hamilton is such a force—her work has spanned implementing global development strategies to doing communications work for NGOs.


**What did you enjoy most about your role with GMMB?** I loved learning more about education and how complex of a subject it really is. At the beginning of my internship, I was acquainted with education policy, but now I can say I’m truly starting to understand it.

**What fictional character do you relate to most? Why?** Leslie Knope from *Parks and Recreation*. I’m not *that* type A, but I share her fiery passion to help people. Also, I love waffles.


**What is your best advice to an intern moving to DC for the first time?** Get lost in different neighborhoods! You won’t get a sense of how the city connects and flows if you only ride the Metro.


**What are the do’s and don’ts of commuting to GMMB from various places in the DMV?** Take advantage of the Washington Harbour shuttle buses that run to various Metro lines. They make my commute so much easier—and less expensive.

**What is your best advice to an intern moving to DC for the first time?** Go to a cheap concert at Black Cat! I’ve never spent more than $10 on tickets, and I’ve always made a friend.


**Where did you eat lunch most often? Favorite dish?** Not lunch, but I often met my younger sister for a breakfast of cranberry-orange toast and coffee at Farmers Fishers Bakers.


**What fictional character do you most relate to? Why?** Claudia Kincaid in *From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler*. She appreciates correct grammar, impulsively spends all of her money on ice cream, and her home away from home is the Met.

**What is your best advice to an intern moving to DC for the first time?** Explore! It’s easy to stay in your own little corner of the city and not see what the rest of DC has to offer. There are so many free things to do that are worth taking advantage of.


**Where is your favorite work spot in GMMB?** The second-level patio. When it was warm out, I loved going out there to get work done. It’s sunny with a great view of the Potomac and the Georgetown Waterfront Park.


**What are the do’s and don’ts of commuting to GMMB from various places in the DMV?** DO: Find podcasts to listen to! Whether you’re walking or taking the Metro, it will make the commute go by much more quickly, and you can learn a lot. DON’T: Get too distracted by all the dogs going on their morning walks in Georgetown.

**Where did you eat lunch most often? Favorite dish?** Definitely Falafel Inc. You can get a sandwich with extra falafel and hummus for only $4, and all the sides are only $3. I recommend getting their za’atar fries because they have so much tasty seasoning on them. What makes this place even better is that for every $10 spent, the shop feeds a refugee by donating part of its revenue to the World Food Programme.


**What fictional character do you relate to most? Why?** Neo from the Matrix—he’s a quiet programmer with a curious mind to learn new things.


**What lessons did you learn about professional life while at GMMB?** There is always room for improvement when working in a professional environment. Also, don’t be afraid to ask for help because everyone here wants you to learn and grow!

**What fictional character do you relate to most? Why?** Tia Landry from *Sister, Sister*. She always wanted to soak up as much knowledge as she could and perform to the best of her ability. Also, her friends often had to literally beg her to let loose and have some fun. Once she’s out though, she’s up for a good time—definitely me.


**What did you learn about yourself at GMMB?** I’ve learned that the way I position myself to others (and to myself) is vital. I have the power to influence how I’m perceived—and that starts with how I perceive myself.


**What did you enjoy most about your role with GMMB?** GMMB has opened my eyes to the power of using social media to advance great causes. Daily, I had the opportunity to inform and inspire people to take action on important issues—all on apps they’ve already integrated into their everyday lives.

**Was there a GMMBer whose position/story/career you found fascinating? What did you learn from them?** John Gundlach, because he went back to school after discovering that he needed another degree to really do what he loved. His story made me feel okay about being a 25-year-old intern!


**What lessons did you learn about professional life while at GMMB?** That it’s OK to mess up as long as you own up to your mistakes.


**What is your best advice to an intern moving to DC for the first time?** Try to find a place to stay for free. Also, don’t be so hard on yourself for not being perfect!

**What fictional character do you relate to most? Why?** The character I most *want* to relate to is Valentine Wiggin from the *Ender’s Game* series because she is such a rock star in terms of shaping positive change and being brilliant, but I don’t think I’m quite that cool. I’m probably more like Mae in *The Circle* because she just kind of gets lucky.


**What is your best advice to an intern moving to DC for the first time?** Don’t. Move to Seattle instead! *[Editor’s note: Elizabeth works in our West Coast office.]* If you do move to Seattle for the first time, invest in a raincoat because people will judge if you use an umbrella.


**What did you enjoy most about your role with GMMB?** I love getting to learn about how different organizations are addressing inequities in the world. I am specifically passionate about education reform, and I’ve been able to learn what modern education reform looks like by working with clients who support education equity.

**What are the do’s and don’ts of commuting to GMMB from various places in the DMV****?** DO NOT stand on the left side of the Metro escalator.


**What did you enjoy most about your role with GMMB?** Every project for every client at GMMB changes the world for the better, and you can’t beat having the opportunity to make the world a better place every day.


**What lessons did you learn about professional life while at GMMB?** You can create incredibly professional work while wearing jeans.

**What did you enjoy most about your role with GMMB?** GMMB allowed me more creative freedom than any place I have ever worked. My supervisor was great about giving me leeway to struggle through the creative process and make my mark on projects. No one holds your hand here—you get to do real work.


**Was there a GMMBer whose position/story/career you found fascinating? What did you learn from them?** There are a lot of cool people at GMMB. I can’t name just one. Annie Burns is hilarious and always wants to know how people are doing. She is part of the culture at GMMB that eliminates any barriers of communication. Jim Margolis is also incredible. He’s worked with some of the most iconic names in American politics, but as successful as he is, he’s approachable and genuinely passionate about the work everyone at every level is doing for GMMB.


**What lessons did you learn about professional life while at GMMB?** The devil is in the details; things that may seem small really mean the most. I’ve also learned diversity is crucial to a thriving work culture. I want to surround myself with people who challenge me and the way I look at the world.

**What is your best advice to an intern moving to DC for the first time?** If you like sports, find your college alumni group. Most universities have an alumni group that puts on watch parties for big games.


**What fictional character do you relate to most? Why?** Calvin from *Calvin and Hobbes*. I find the most enjoyable things in life happen outdoors. And if it’s going to snow, it might as well blizzard.


**What are the do’s and don’ts of commuting to GMMB from various places in the DMV****?** Every day, I walk to work from Glover Park. I say if you can walk to work in less than 30 minutes, you should do it. Even though I always follow the same route, I see something new every day.

**What is your best advice to an intern moving to DC for the first time?** Take advantage of the restaurant scene! DC is an exciting city with some amazing restaurants, but what’s even better is that you never know who you might meet.


**What did you learn about yourself at GMMB?** I learned that I don’t have to protest in the streets or work directly in the government to create change. At GMMB, I get to make a difference doing what I do best.


**What lessons did you learn about professional life while at GMMB?** There will always be people ready to help you out, but only when you make the effort to help yourself first. If you want to work on a project with another team, take initiative and reach out to that project manager. If there is someone you admire and want to learn more from, ask them to go get coffee and chat. People admire those who take initiative to make the most out of their time.
