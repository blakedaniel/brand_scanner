##### Climate, Health and Equity Brief

 All Eyes on Glasgow
===================

***The Climate, Health & Equity Brief is GMMB’s take on the week’s news on the current impacts of climate change. If you haven’t subscribed yet, you can do so by [clicking here](https://mailchimp.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=f2f8c4bdabe1a2a83f914e813&id=4a13a601e2).***


**Hot Topic:** **COP26.**World leaders will descend on Glasgow, Scotland this weekend for the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26). The two-week summit is a critical arena for building consensus and solidifying the ambitious commitments needed to avert climate catastrophe.


This week’s Brief, like most weeks, shows just how important COP26 is. A new report found that we’re falling short on all 40 monitored indicators of climate progress. Global climate financing must increase to $5 trillion annually by 2030 to sufficiently avert catastrophic warming. And studies continue to show that climate change is already taking a toll on mental and physical health, increasing premature deaths, threatening economic instability, and having a dire effect on developing nations with limited resources.


COP26 is a tremendously important opportunity to focus the world on the steps that are now non-negotiable in order to avert a climate catastrophe. Just a few of the things we’ll be watching closely:


* How many—and which—countries will commit to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 or sooner, a move experts agree is now required by nearly every country in the world to avert climate disaster
* How the decisions by China and Russia to skip the conference will impact commitments from other nations
* Whether countries will agree to set a ‘floor’ for the price of carbon, which would shift the financial burden for emissions to those responsible and create an incentive to reduce reliance on fossil fuels
* How discord over climate spending in the U.S. Congress will impact President Biden’s ability to persuade other nations to act
* What concrete steps will be taken to reduce methane emissions, which have 80 times more atmospheric warming power in the short-term than CO2
* What progress will be made to move coal-dependent countries toward clean energy, and
* Whether there will be consensus about eliminating subsidies for fossil fuels


The question is not whether these and other decisions made over the next two weeks will have impacts on a planetary level, as that much is certain—but whether humanity will rise to meet the unprecedented challenge before us before it is too late.


*— Matt & Traci, GMMB*
