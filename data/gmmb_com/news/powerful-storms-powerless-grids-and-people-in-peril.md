**Hot Topic: The perfect storm.** A collision of extreme weather and a lack of climate change resilience had tragic outcomes this week as massive winter storms pummeled large swaths of the United States. In Texas, demand for heat increased sharply just as power plants across the state tripped offline due to extreme cold, leaving millions of people without power and bringing the state’s entire electric grid within “seconds or minutes” of catastrophic failure.  At least 47 people have perished to date as a result of the storm and its aftermath, including some who froze to death in their own homes.


Associating climate change with this week’s freezing conditions may seem counterintuitive. Yet scientists warn that planetary warming is indeed the likely culprit, as fossil-fuel-driven emissions heat the Arctic at twice the rate of the rest of the planet, causing the jet stream to weaken and allowing frigid air from the polar vortex to reach further and further south.


Due in large part to industrial activity, Texas consumes more energy than any other state. It is also the only state that operates an independent, deregulated energy grid that is completely closed off from the rest of the country. This left them unable to import power from other states this week as temperatures plummeted and power supplies failed. The result was rolling blackouts, leaving millions of households without power just when they needed it most. Experts say that many low-income communities and communities of color were the first to be hit with outages, and could be among the last to be reconnected, leaving them without heat or power for days.


As the need for greater climate change mitigation and resilience grows more urgent, fortifying electric grids in the U.S.—and taking the multiple and even counterintuitive threats posed by climate change seriously—will increasingly become a matter of life and death.
