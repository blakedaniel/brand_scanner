**Hot Topic: Overlapping disasters.** Two extreme weather events have taken hold in the U.S. this week even as the coronavirus pandemic continues to rage across the country. Following recent fires in Arizona, Nevada, Oregon and Utah, the Apple Fire in Southern California’s Cherry Valley has already burned more than 28,000 acres and forced nearly 8,000 residents to evacuate. The blazes have produced plumes of smoke that rise 30,000 feet and are impacting air quality up to 300 miles away, potentially increasing the risk for respiratory complications and severe COVID-19 cases among those exposed to the smoke.


On the East Coast, Tropical Storm Isaias has caused at least twelve deaths and left millions without power following widespread tornadoes and flooding. Isaias is already the ninth named storm in the Atlantic so far this year, a feat that has never been reached so early into the U.S. hurricane season. A new report estimates that the U.S. is on track for 24 named storms this year—nearly double the annual U.S. average.


Meanwhile, another study found that as climate change continues to speed sea-level rise, extreme high tides and massive storm surges will become much more frequent and intense, permanently submerging many low-lying coastal areas and putting tens of millions more people and trillions of dollars in assets at risk. Yet another study found that extreme heat could kill more people than all infectious diseases *combined* this century without fast action to reign in emissions and move to renewable sources of power.


While extreme weather continues to intensify and become the rule rather than the exception, one study out this week provides a silver lining. Researchers at Duke University found that limiting warming to 2°C over the next 50 years would result in enormous benefits to the health of Americans and prevent 4.5 million premature climate-related deaths. The question is, will we rise to meet that challenge?
