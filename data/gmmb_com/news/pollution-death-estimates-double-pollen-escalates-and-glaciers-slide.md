**Hot Topic: Life or death.**New research out of Harvard dropped a bombshell this week with study results showing that 20 percent of global deaths in 2018—nearly *one in five*and more than double previous estimates—were attributable to particulate matter pollution from the burning of fossil fuels.


According to researchers, previous studies relied on satellite and surface observations to estimate airborne particulate matter concentrations—but those observations couldn’t differentiate between fossil fuel particles and those from dust, wildfire smoke or other sources. With this study, researchers turned to a 3-D model that allowed them to divide the globe into 31 x 37-mile sections to assess hyperlocal pollution specifics. This new model found the Eastern United States to be one of the areas of the globe most affected.


Yet another study out this week found that since 1990, the annual U.S. pollen season has lengthened by 20 days and pollen concentrations have increased by an average of 21 percent, extending and intensifying seasonal misery for millions of Americans. In addition to exacerbating respiratory conditions like asthma, experts warn that high-pollen periods are associated with greater susceptibility to respiratory contagions, including the COVID-19 virus.


And the threats posed by extreme weather continue. In the Himalayas, where glaciers are now melting twice as fast as they were just 20 years ago, a horrific landslide barreled down the mountainside on Sunday, snapping and washing away a hydroelectric dam, killing 31 people and leaving nearly 200 missing and feared dead. And a new study confirmed that California’s annual wildfire season continues to grow longer due to warming temperatures. This is terrible news for the state, where last year more than four million acres burned and air quality plummeted to some of the worst levels in the world.


Finally, studies this week in the journals *The Lancet* and *Nature* confirm that even more catastrophic effects of climate change are on the horizon unless countries significantly increase their emissions reduction goals. With the next UN Climate Change Conference set for the end of this year, all eyes will be on global leaders, including the U.S., to introduce and follow through on greater commitments for the health of the planet and its people.
