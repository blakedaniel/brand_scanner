**Hot Topic: Dueling crises.**  With Russia’s continued, unprovoked war against the people of Ukraine, the world is at a crossroads. The global energy crisis has taken center stage as national leaders struggle with ways to admonish Vladimir Putin, meet domestic energy demand and contain rapidly rising fuel costs while continuing progress toward their climate goals.


The European Union and at least a dozen other countries have levied economic sanctions primarily targeting Russian elites, while two countries—the US and Canada—imposed immediate bans on Russian energy imports, undercutting a significant source of revenue for the Russian military. In Europe—where weaning off Russian energy is a much more challenging prospect—the UK pledged to phase out imports of Russian oil by year’s end, and the EU announced it would eliminate the 27-nation bloc’s dependence on Russian energy imports by 2027.


The crisis has laid bare the perilously interconnected nature of national, economic and energy security at time when our planet can ill afford to pause on climate progress. Unfortunately, plans to phase out coal across Europe have ground to a halt as countries dependent on Russian fossil fuels scramble for available alternatives. And in the US, the Biden administration is now pushing the oil and gas industry to drive up production in the short term to help offset the loss of Russian energy imports.


The real question is whether world leaders can leverage this moment to create momentum toward energy independence rooted in renewable resources. This would allow us to meet the moment at this time of war while protecting against future energy crises and laying the groundwork to curb emissions long-term.


One new analysis found that President Biden’s proposed incentives for vehicle electrification alone—now stalled in Congress—would eliminate America’s need for Russian oil by 2027. In turn, that reduction in demand would help insulate the US from price volatility in the global energy market and significantly curb emissions. Yet Republican lawmakers are almost uniformly rejecting new clean energy spending in response to Russia’s invasion.


The world is facing a critical moment for the energy transition, and in desperate need of public support for a shift to renewables. Only time will tell if pain at the pump will turbocharge—or derail—public demand and political will for clean energy solutions to take hold.

Despite Florida’s [wildfire season](https://apnews.com/article/wildfires-fires-florida-hurricanes-evacuations-81f0354b5cec820324e313ad5eb7b82d) kicking off just one week ago, three major blazes in the Panhandle have already scorched more than [34,000 acres](https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/09/weather/florida-panhandle-wildfires-wednesday/index.html) and forced the evacuation of more than 1,100 homes, causing additional devastation in areas still reeling from 2018’s Hurricane Michael.

In the first potential update to [tailpipe regulations](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/03/07/biden-epa-heavy-trucks/) in two decades, the EPA has proposed strict limits on heavy-duty vehicle emissions which cause smog and exacerbate respiratory health issues among communities that reside near highways and warehouses.

A new Energy Innovation [analysis](https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/rQqTCy6EPi7MVGfg8zZ3?domain=energyinnovation.org) found that the electric vehicle provisions in President Biden’s stalled Build Back Better Act could cut oil production in the United States by 180 million barrels of oil by 2030, a move which would both help [reduce dependence](https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/cXuxCzBGpfG2VXHxUUyW?domain=nytimes.com "https://protect-eu.mimecast.com/s/cXuxCzBGpfG2VXHxUUyW?domain=nytimes.com") on foreign fossil fuels and meet climate goals.
