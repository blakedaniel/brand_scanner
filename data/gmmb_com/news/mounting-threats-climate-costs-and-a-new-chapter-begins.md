***The Climate, Health & Equity Brief is GMMB’s take on the week’s news on the current impacts of climate change. If you haven’t subscribed yet, you can do so by [clicking here](https://mailchimp.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=f2f8c4bdabe1a2a83f914e813&id=4a13a601e2).***


**Hot Topic:****Ready for battle.**As President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take office on Wednesday, several major U.S. and international crises already await him. Each day, U.S. COVID-19 infections and deaths reach horrifying new milestones. Small businesses in cities large and small are struggling to survive. Tens of millions of Americans are in dire financial straits, facing unemployment, eviction and food insecurity. And the nation is more ideologically divided than ever, with formidable threats to our democracy both at home and abroad. Unfortunately, climate change is no exception amid the chaos.


Last year’s #DumpsterFire meme has been particularly fitting, with 2020 emerging as one of the two hottest years ever recorded on planet Earth. Scientists now warn that without immediate action, planetary warming could surpass the alarming 1.5°C tipping point within just ten years, causing severe impacts on human and natural life. Here in the U.S., the Southwest faces a “forever drought” due to persistently low rainfall. More extreme storms slammed our shores in 2020 than at any time in recorded history. And wildfire smoke now accounts for half of all fine-particle pollution in the Western states, effectively wiping out a decade of progress on air pollution.


The climate crisis also has a steep price tag. Researchers attributed nearly one-third of the $199 billion in 1998-2017 U.S. flood damages to climatechange, and a UN report warns that the tens of billions of dollars in global, weather-related economic losses will only increase unless governments move immediately to curb emissions and implement climate resilience projects.


Despite these facts, there is reason for hope. This week, leaders from 50 countries vowed to more than double Earth’s formally protected land and sea from 13 to 30 percent. The World Bank announced plans to invest $5 billion over the next five years to fund climate-resilient projects across Africa. And with next week’s inauguration of Joe Biden, the White House is set to become the new “center of gravity” in the climate fight, where the hard work of reversing years of environmental destruction wrought by the Trump Administration will soon begin.


Here at the Brief, we are beyond grateful to begin this new chapter—and thankful that here in the U.S., progress on climate change will no longer be stymied by those who have treated our natural world with contempt.
