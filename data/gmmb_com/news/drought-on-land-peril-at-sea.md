 Drought on land, peril at sea

**Hot Topic: Troubled waters.** This week, a NASA report revealed that the planet now traps *double* the amount of heat it absorbed in 2005—signifying that we have reached an “unprecedented” imbalance between the energy the planet traps and what it radiates back into space. The troubling and multi-faceted impacts of planetary heating are currently on full display across the American West, with sweltering heat fueling intense drought conditions in more than a dozen states. Yet as bad as the situation is on land, it is the world’s oceans that absorb over 90 percent of the earth’s heat—and as temperatures rise, so do the consequences to sea life, marine-drive economies and entire ecosystems.


In the Mediterranean Sea, where scientists say ocean temperatures are increasing 20 percent faster than the global average, the economic impact is likely to be vast. Climate change puts an estimated $450 billion at risk in the region annually as the rising sea threatens communities, extreme weather harms coastal infrastructure, and thousands of new species invade the now tropically-warm waters.


In the nearby Sea of Marmara, which borders Turkey, a pervasive, mucus-like substance known as “sea snot” is wreaking havoc. The smelly muck, which reaches depths of 100 feet in some places, is produced by microorganisms thriving on wastewater runoff into an increasingly warming ocean. The result is suffocating marine life, accumulating viruses and bacteria, reduced oxygen in the water, and a grave threat to the livelihoods of fishermen along Istanbul’s coast.


And the impacts of water warming on economies and ecosystems aren’t limited to oceans. In the Klamath River, located along a Yurok Tribe’s reservation, warming waters and low water levels have created a breeding ground for a parasite that has now killed more than half the river’s juvenile salmon. Parasites thrive in warm waters and drought-like conditions, but they are also easily spread by plastic debris. Rafts of increasingly pervasive plastic waste drift across bodies of water, transporting marine species and potentially harmful and invasive microorganisms to new regions along with the flotsam.


As summer begins and temperatures rise, people across the globe are flocking to nearby bodies of water to beat the heat of inland life.  Unfortunately, our waterways and shores are increasingly plagued with problems resulting from unchecked pollution and rapidly rising temperatures. Our reliance on fossil fuels and the enjoyment and sustenance we receive from our oceans and rivers are connected—and we cannot continue to have both. To protect the waters we hold dear, we must reduce the fossil-fuel byproducts that are warming and polluting our planet before it’s too late.
