Hot Topic: Pipelines. In just one week, three of the most controversial pipeline projects across the U.S. have come to a halt, signaling a major win for both the environment and the activists that have long fought pipeline development in their communities.
In South Dakota, a four-year legal battle between the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and developers of the Dakota Access Pipeline finally came to an end, with a federal judge halting development and ordering the pipeline to be drained of oil by August 5, pending environmental review. In Virginia, developers of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline decided to cancel the project over continued delays and mounting costs from litigation proceedings. And the Supreme Court rejected a Trump administration request to develop the northern leg of the Keystone XL pipeline through Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska, ruling that the pipeline’s impact on ecosystems, drinking water and public health must be evaluated before the project can continue.
In even more good news, Sydney, Australia is now powered entirely by wind and solar sources following a $41 million green energy project. In California, officials have adopted the nation’s first rule requiring all trucks sold in the state to be zero emission by 2045. And a newly announced $2.5 billion philanthropic climate fund will fuel investments in a green COVID recovery and a transition to clean energy across Southeast Asia.
While the fight against the ongoing climate impact of fossil fuels is far from over, this week’s developments illustrate the impact that climate activism, responsible action and the power of philanthropy can bring to the U.S. and world.
