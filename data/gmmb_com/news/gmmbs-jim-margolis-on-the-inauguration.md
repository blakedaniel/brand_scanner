Jim Margolis, a senior partner at GMMB, served as a Senior Advisor to Barack Obama in both his 2008 and 2012 campaigns for the White House, taking a lead role in each cycle’s advertising effort and helping direct the campaign as a member of the core strategic team.


Jim also co-managed and produced the two Presidential Inaugurals, with creative and thematic responsibility for the four-day events. GMMB-staff members interviewed Jim about his role in the 57th Presidential Inauguration, highlighting what the traditions mean to him and which moments he found most memorable.
