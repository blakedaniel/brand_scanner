This year at GMMB, we tried something new. Instead of hiring interns for a single college semester, we brought them on from September through April. During this time, they experienced a lot—from the 2018 midterm elections to our company-wide professional development and team-building retreat. Our 2018-2019 interns have become an integral part of the GMMB team, and before they depart, we asked them to share a little about themselves and their experiences:

**School:** The George Washington University


**Major(s) in college:** International Affairs and Global Public Health


**Hometown:** Framingham, Massachusetts


**Team:** Global/Domestic Health



**What’s the most memorable account/project that you worked on?** I did a lot of work for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation—the most memorable project I worked on for them was a brief about the state of malnutrition in Pakistan that was presented to Pakistan’s prime minister.



**What was your favorite “Only at GMMB” moment?** The election night watch party for the 2018 midterm elections!



**Favorite book you’ve read recently:** *Being Mortal* by Atul Gawande.



**How do you aspire to create real and lasting change in the world after leaving GMMB?** I’d like to continue working toward a world where everyone has access to comprehensive health care.



**Any particular advice from a fellow GMMBer that has stuck with you?** In big letters on one of the walls at GMMB, a big sign reads *Respect All*. Although this advice is simple, seeing this sign every day helped me to always keep it in the front of my mind.

**School:** The George Washington University


**Major(s) in college:**Communications, English and Creative Writing


**Hometown:** Tegucigalpa, Honduras


**Team:** Global/Domestic Health


 


**What’s the most memorable account/project that you worked on?** Think Babies—the overall campaign and purpose speaks to me. It’s really encouraging to support a campaign that helps improve the quality of child care for families who struggle to afford it.



**Top three podcast recommendations:** *The Morning Toast*, *TED Radio Hour*, and *Crime Junkie*.



**What’s something you learned at GMMB that has already influenced your life for the better?** Striving to work for something that makes a difference and breaks through the noise. GMMB really helped me figure out what I want to focus on after graduation.



**What’s it like to work in Georgetown?** I love being able to take a break and walk along the waterfront—and having the option to grab a cupcake from Baked & Wired.



**Any particular advice from a fellow GMMBer that has stuck with you?** Aileen Andres, a senior account executive on the Global Health team, once told me to follow my gut—it knows better.

**School:** Virginia Commonwealth University


**Major(s) in college:** Mass Communications


**Hometown:** Seoul, South Korea


**Team:** Creative



**What’s the most memorable account/project that you worked on?** Designing the Take Your Kid to Work Day shirt. There was a lot of room for creativity, and it was a time for me to think about my fellow GMMBers. I got to reflect on the different personalities that make up GMMB and the great collaboration that goes on despite everyone’s uniqueness.


 


**What was your favorite “Only at GMMB” moment?** My favorite moments usually happen during our Tuesday staff meetings. It’s always good to see all of the accomplishments made at and because of GMMB.



**Favorite book you’ve read recently:** *The Temperature of Language*. It’s a Korean book with short stories in each chapter. The author shares his experience of how certain words and the way people speak can impact people and situations. It’s helped me become more aware of how deeply my words can affect others.


 


**Favorite lunch spot near the office:** Food trucks have been my favorite place to get lunch. Every day there’s something different, and it never disappoints.



**What’s something you learned at GMMB that has already influenced your life for the better?** Everyone here is a hard worker. People are always strategizing, making things better, and talking about the details, and they all know how to prioritize things. I learned so much not only professionally, but also personally.

**School:** Saint Joseph’s University


**Major(s) in college:** Communication


**Hometown:** Takoma Park, Maryland


**Team:** Education/Corporate Social Impact



**What’s the most memorable account/project that you worked on?** The website for the National Collaborative for Infants & Toddlers. The team was awesome, and it was really rewarding to see the organization launch into the world as a huge website full of resources for people working in that space. I did all of the content entry for the site.



**What was your favorite “Only at GMMB” moment?** Having snacks in the cafe with a congressperson was pretty cool!



**How do you aspire to create real and lasting change in the world after leaving GMMB?** By challenging myself and those around me to always do more.



**Your life is now a movie. Which celebrity is narrating?** Jonathan Van Ness.



**Any particular advice from a fellow GMMBer that has stuck with you?** Account Supervisor Dana Cronyn always challenged me to speak up and share my ideas.

**School:** American University


**Major(s) in college:** International Relations


**Hometown:** Henderson, Nevada


**Team:** Education



**What’s the most memorable account/project that you worked on?** Media monitoring around the midterm elections kept me informed about local politics, candidates, and statewide initiatives that I initially knew little about—especially as a newcomer to Seattle.



**How do you aspire to create real and lasting change in the world after leaving GMMB?** I’ll encourage everyone to vote and stay informed about community-wide issues.



**If your life had a theme song, what would it be?** *Transmission* by Joy Division.



**What’s it like to work in Seattle?** Seattle doesn’t get as much rain as I thought it would, but the coffee exceeds my already high expectations.



**Any particular advice from a fellow GMMBer that has stuck with you?** Vice President Frances Bresnahan told me to explore a wide range of opportunities and tasks, even if they don’t align completely with your role.

**School:** University of California San Diego


**Major(s) in college:** Management Science


**Hometown:** San Francisco, California


**Team:** Branding/Education



**What’s the most memorable account/project that you worked on?** Helping create the #MosaicChallenge for Communities In Schools’ [*What We Are Made Of* campaign](https://whatwearemadeof.us/) was not only a fun opportunity for me to work with the creative team, it was also extremely rewarding as I got to see the incredible response the challenge received at SXSW EDU. There’s something so special about being able to see your work living in the world, engaging real people, and making a tangible impact. I assisted with strategic brainstorming, influencer research, gameplay refinement, and copywriting for both client memos and public-facing assets.



**What was your favorite “Only at GMMB” moment?** Basically, any time Director of Brand Strategy Oliver Griswold made a punny dad joke. I don’t think he knows how much joy those jokes bring me.



**If your life had a theme song, what would it be?** *Landslide* by Oh Wonder.



**What’s something you learned at GMMB that has already influenced your life for the better?** Actively pursue the things in your life that you want to see change in. Even if it means putting yourself in uncomfortable situations and hearing your fair share of “no’s,” you’ll emerge stronger and better equipped for the next thing.



**Any particular advice from a fellow GMMBer that has stuck with you?** Account Executive Phoebe Galt once told me to view the uncertainties in life as exciting opportunities for growth and exploration. Rather than feeling daunted by the limitless possibilities that lie ahead, we should feel inspired and energized for whatever it is that life throws our way.
