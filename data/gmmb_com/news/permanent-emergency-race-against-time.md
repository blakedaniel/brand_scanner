 ‘Permanent Emergency’ and a race against time

***The Climate, Health & Equity Brief is GMMB’s take on the week’s news on the current impacts of climate change. If you haven’t subscribed yet, you can do so by [clicking here](https://mailchimp.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=f2f8c4bdabe1a2a83f914e813&id=4a13a601e2).***


**Hot Topic:** **Preventing disaster.** With violent storms and sewage-contaminated floods killing hundreds and devastating towns in Germany and Belgium, continued recording-breaking heat in normally temperate areas, and a 1,000-year megadrought in the American Southwest, this week has looked apocalyptic.


Unfortunately, a new study shows in stark terms how these events are becoming the new norm: a tropical storm’s likeliness to become a major hurricane has increased eight percent every decade. Wildfires in the West are now ravaging double the normal area impacted by fires in any given year. The recent heat dome that scorched the Pacific Northwest made temperatures soar as much as 11 degrees above record *all-time* highs. And crumbling glaciers are producing quasi-earthquakes as they collapse into the sea.


With all signs pointing to an increasingly severe, ‘permanent climate emergency,’ action is more necessary than ever as we enter a race against time. Today, we are choosing to be optimistic about the moves around the world this week that give us a sliver of hope:


* A French court took the extraordinary step of ruling that the French government must take “all necessary additional steps” to meet Paris Agreement targets, or face sanctions;
* The U.K. announced that it would end its use of coal for electricity by October 2024, a year earlier than previously planned;
* The European Commission proposed a package of aggressive new laws that would reduce emissions 55 percent by 2030 and reach net-zero emissions by 2050;
* 140 mayors across the United States jointly called on Congress to includes aggressive climate measures in the U.S. infrastructure package; and
* More than 30 newsrooms have committed to using to using the phrase “climate emergency” when covering details of the climate crisis.


As the world prepares for the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow this November, we hold out hope that government leaders will continue progress and double down on their commitments toward reaching carbon neutrality and preventing climate apocalypse.
