Hot Topic: International climate woes. Two major reports and a number of global developments this week offer troubling insight into the progression of climate impacts around the world. The 30th annual State of the Climate Report from the American Meteorological Society found that 2019 was the third hottest year in human history behind 2015 and 2016. In addition, greenhouse gas concentrations and sea levels rose to all-time highs, highlighting the direct influence of planet-warming emissions on key climate indicators. And despite initial optimism around lowered emissions during COVID-19 lockdowns, another report revealed that the long-term climate impact from the shutdowns will be a mere 0.01°C reduction in global temperatures, demonstrating the continued need for urgent climate action.
In India, severe climate change consequences are already on full display. Mumbai, one of the country’s most populated cities, is facing a devastating monsoon season that has caused catastrophic flooding and displaced four million people after nearly 83 inches of rainfall in just over one month. Despite this, India’s government has announced plans to establish 40 new coal mines to boost the country’s economy following COVID-19. This project would destroy indigenous lands, clear more than 400,000 acres of forest and exacerbate extreme weather events such as the Mumbai monsoons.
Meanwhile, scientists are bracing for another environmental catastrophe in Chernobyl. The city, which was left almost completely abandoned after a horrific nuclear power plant explosion in 1986, is now overtaken by forest. With warming temperatures expected to intensify the impending wildfire season later this month, potential blazes would release lethal amounts of radioactive toxins into the atmosphere and lead to grave health implications for surrounding populations.
Here in the U.S., and despite the aggressive environmental rollbacks of the last four years, there are signs of hope. Democratic nominee Joe Biden has chosen environmental justice champion Kamala Harris as his running mate, and a new report notes that 41 U.S. states managed to cut carbon emissions between 2005 and 2017, even as their economies grew.
