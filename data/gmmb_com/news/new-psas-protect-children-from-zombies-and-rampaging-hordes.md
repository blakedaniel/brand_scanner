 New PSAS Protect Children from Zombies and Rampaging Hordes!

No more boarding up the house. And there’s no need for that brick wall either—so put down the cinderblock. A TV remote is all you need to protect your kids from zombies, rampaging hordes and other potentially inappropriate characters and TV content. That’s the message behind two new Public Service Announcements created by GMMB on behalf of the National Cable & Telecommunications Association (NCTA).


The PSAs are part of the ongoing TV Boss awareness campaign, an effort by the cable industry, broadcasters and Hollywood, to provide parents with the tools and information they need to block content they feel may not be suitable for their families. With the built-in parental controls in cable boxes and the V-Chip incorporated into virtually all TVs made over the past decade, blocking things such as zombies and rampaging hordes is as easy as clicking the remote control. GMMB wrote and post-produced the PSAs, which were directed by Matt Pittroff of Twist Films. “This is the kind of opportunity we love: creative, cutting-edge campaigns that make a difference,” said GMMB Creative Director Michael Carpenter. “These spots are designed to cut through the clutter and remind parents about the ease of using parental controls and the TV Ratings system.”


As the national conversation intensifies about the level of violence in our society, parents increasingly are looking for ways to limit their children’s exposure to content they may find unsuitable. That’s why NCTA is working with broadcasters, film studios, theater owners, and other entertainment purveyors to inform parents that accessible, easy-to-use TV parental controls and TV and film ratings are available. The new PSAs, which reflect a consistent thematic approach employed by the entertainment industry over the past decade, are the most current elements of a national campaign designed to speak to parents and caregivers. “Our objective here is simple,” said David Pierce, Vice President, Public Affairs for NCTA. “Parents shouldn’t have to work hard to protect their kids from scary or violent content. Our message is, ‘You don’t have to!’ GMMB has done a great job in helping us spread the word by designing amusing ads that we hope will remind parents that they can simply pick up their TV remotes, and use parental controls.” More information about this initiative is available at: [www.TheTVBoss.org](http://www.TheTVBoss.org).
