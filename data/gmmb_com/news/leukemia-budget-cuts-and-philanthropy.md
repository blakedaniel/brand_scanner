The Climate, Health & Equity Brief is GMMB’s take on the week’s news on the current impacts of climate change. If you haven’t subscribed yet, you can do so by clicking here.
Hot Topic: Responsibility. As global reliance on fossil fuels continues to stoke the climate crisis and drive adverse impacts on human health, those causing and benefiting financially from carbon emissions are failing to take responsibility for their actions.
One new study found that in 2019, ten U.S. oil refineries exceeded federal limits for emissions of benzene, a chemical linked to the development of blood disorders, including leukemia. Another study shows that up to 53 percent of air quality-related premature deaths in the U.S. result from emissions originating from pollution sources across state lines. And a third study found that while all countries are failing to ensure that children will grow up to enjoy a livable planet, wealthy, high carbon-emitting countries are causing the most harm, while children in poor countries suffer disproportionately as a result.
Despite ample evidence on the actions necessary to slow the climate crisis, the Trump administration continues its assault on environmental protections. The newly issued White House budget proposes to hobble or fully eliminate climate programs across several government agencies, while allocating new funds to develop additional markets for coal. Cuts range from tossing the Energy Star appliance rating program and eliminating millions for U.S. land conservation projects to stripping protections for streams, wetlands and groundwater and slashing funds for cleanup of toxic waste sites.
In good news, Jeff Bezos and Bill and Melinda Gates each announced major new commitments to climate this week, showing how private entities are helping to fill the void as our leaders shirk the responsibility to protect our planet today and for future generations.
