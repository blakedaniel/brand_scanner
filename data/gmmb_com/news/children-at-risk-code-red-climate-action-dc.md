**Hot Topic:** **For the children****.** As Congress moved forward sweeping legislation that would expand national climate programs this week, new research highlights the intense impacts of climate change on the world’s children.


The Children’s Climate Risk Index, which combines high-resolution maps of climate and environmental impacts with maps of child vulnerability, found that nearly every child around the world was at risk from at least one impact of the climate crisis and pollution. More dire still, nearly half of the world’s 2.2 million children face three to four impacts—including heatwaves, storms and drought—simultaneously.


Another study found that the impacts of wildfires begin before birth, leading to as many as 7,000 premature births in the state of California between 2007 and 2012. The study found that a month of exposure to wildfire smoke was associated with a 20 percent increase in preterm birth.


With science continuing to show just how dire the impact of the climate crisis is and the United Nations warning this week of “code red for humanity” due to rapid global warming, the House of Representatives this week passed a $3.5 billion-dollar budget plan that allocates significant funding for climate programs, including a new tax on imported fossil fuels, federal aid for clean energy developers and investments in low-polluting vehicles.


While the bill still needs to pass the Senate, it’s a heartening step forward—and analysis by Senate Majority Leader Schumer’s office shows that the climate measures contained in the bipartisan infrastructure bill and the reconciliation bill, combined, would put the U.S. on track to meet President Biden’s goal of reducing emissions by 50 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.
