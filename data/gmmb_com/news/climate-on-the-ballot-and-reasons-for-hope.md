Climate, Health and Equity Brief Climate on the ballot, and reasons for hope
October 30, 2020
 
The Climate, Health & Equity Brief is GMMB’s take on the week’s news on the current impacts of climate change. If you haven’t subscribed yet, you can do so by clicking here.
Hot Topic: Signs of hope. It’s hard to believe that the U.S. election is just days away. Here at the Brief, we’ve been considering the weight of the last four years and the associated dismantling of nearly 100 environmental protections necessary to sustaining our planet. And yet, we are choosing to be optimistic about the future.
Even in the midst of increasingly devastating climate impacts, we see the opportunity—now in our hands, and just around the corner—to build back better. We are choosing to focus on hope, and to highlight developments from this week that, together with the potential for a change in leadership, point to momentum to fight back in a meaningful way on climate change:
New poll results reveal that 57 percent of all registered voters in the U.S. support the phasing out of fossil fuels, including an unprecedented 41 percent of Republicans;
A report has found that even in majority-Republican, fossil fuel-friendly states, energy generation from renewable sources is surging;
A major investment bank is forecasting that electric vehicles could achieve cost parity with fossil-fuel vehicles within three years, and could make up 40 percent of the global auto market by 2030;
A newly released plan from the Biden campaign is promoting environmental justice for Indigenous communities and strengthening U.S. relations with tribal nations;
Measures focused on funding climate plans and advancing a transition to clean energy are on the ballot in seven cities and states across the country;
Japan and South Korea, among dozens of other nations and municipalities, have announced commitments to become carbon-neutral by 2050; and
Fifteen U.S. states are now implementing 100 percent clean electricity policies and pollution reduction programs.
Beyond the developments of this week, there are larger forces at play that also give us hope. While COVID-19 has forced restrictions on virtually all aspects of life, the global movement for climate action has continued stronger than ever, with a growing number of youth—and the resounding voice of a 17-year-old activist—leading the way.
And leaders have begun to take action. Governments around the world are looking to green transitions as the key to COVID-19 recovery. These include the EU, which is making a 60-percent reduction in emissions by 2030 a central strategy for its economic recovery, and South Korea, which has committed to creating 1.9 million jobs by developing green technologies.
In the corporate world, dozens of major companies have pledged to go carbon neutral. Some major banks have announced commitments to divest from fossil fuels and achieve global net-zero emissions. At least 13 U.S. coal plants have been permanently shuttered this year, and coal is increasingly being phased out around the world.
We hope that, like us, you’re heading into election week with a sense of stubborn optimism and feeling of hope that meaningful action to support biodiversity, clean air, environmental justice and human health could soon be the rule, rather than the exception, in the United States.
