The Climate, Health & Equity Brief is GMMB’s take on the week’s news on the current impacts of climate change. If you haven’t subscribed yet, you can do so by clicking here.
Hot Topic: As the world burns. After over a month of negotiations, the Senate is expected to vote on its bipartisan infrastructure package on Monday. At the same time, Democrats are on a tight timeline to develop the framework for a budget resolution that will provide $3.5 trillion for the climate provisions and other social services that Republicans slashed from President Biden’s original proposal. But as political roadblocks continue to hinder the future of both pieces of legislation, members of Congress need only step outside and breathe Washington, D.C.’s uncharacteristically smoky air for a reminder of what’s at stake.
This week, smoke from more than 100 fires in the U.S. West Coast and Canada reached East Coast cities including Washington, New York and Philadelphia with their noxious fumes and harmful particulates, emphasizing the increasingly far-reaching impacts of wildfire season. Oregon’s Bootleg fire, sparked on July 6 and already the largest U.S. wildfire this year, has scorched more than 400,000 acres of forest and grasslands so far—an area almost ten times the size of Washington, D.C. The flames have become so massive and hot that the fire is changing the weather in the region, generating fire tornadoes that propel embers, spark more flames, increase fire danger and create erratic conditions that hinder efforts to control the burn.
And as fire season picks up, agricultural producers from California to Canada are facing even more devastation. Many Napa vineyards are now struggling to find insurers willing to provide coverage for fires. Even for wineries whose grapes remain untouched by flames, smoke and particulates from nearby wildfires are tainting entire vintages, threatening livelihoods and the dealing a setback to the region’s wine output.
And fires aren’t the only threat to the grapes. Record-breaking heatwaves have prompted vintners to protect their fruit with tactics ranging from shade cloth to sunscreen. In Canada, temperatures topping 110°F have ruined up to 50 percent of many crop yields; June’s heat wave alone led to cherries roasting on trees, wheat drying up in fields and livestock facing feed and water shortages.
Despite the fact that the U.S. has already had four heat waves this year, meteorologists are predicting another week of sweltering temperatures across the lower 48 next week. Climate change is no longer a far-away threat to our lives and economies, so our national priorities and policies must reflect the urgency of this crisis. A recent report from the Rocky Mountain Institute emphasized “the most important year to reduce carbon pollution is this year,” underscoring how each passing day of gridlock on the Hill delays urgent climate action. It’s time to wake up and smell the smoke—and then pass the legislation we need for a cleaner, healthier future.

A recent analysis of extreme heat impacts in Oregon’s Multnomah County found that 61 percent of deaths resulting from recent heat waves occurred in zip codes with a higher poverty rate than the county average, underscoring the disproportionate effects of extreme heat on low-income communities. (The Washington Post)
An increasing number of immigrants from agrarian areas across Latin America are making the dangerous trek to the U.S. border as natural disasters and the changing climate decimate their crops and worsen food insecurity, malnutrition and poverty. (Politico)
Despite being disproportionately vulnerable to climate extremes, more than 500 low-income communities and communities of color in the U.S. have been left without any funding from FEMA resiliency grants due to a lack of state and local requisite matching funds. (NBC News)
Politics & Economy
After the bipartisan infrastructure plan failed a test vote in the Senate, Democrats are considering whether to pair physical infrastructure plans with a separate plan to address climate change, child care and health care. (CNBC)
Environmental and voting rights advocates are worried that proposed voting restrictions across the U.S. could reduce voting turnout among communities of color, who are more likely to support progressive energy and climate policies than white voters. (Politico)
