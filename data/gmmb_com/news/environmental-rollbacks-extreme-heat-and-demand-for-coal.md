The Climate, Health & Equity Brief is GMMB’s take on the week’s news on the current impacts of climate change. If you haven’t subscribed yet, you can do so by clicking here.
Hot Topic: Rollbacks. The New York Times updated its comprehensive tracker of the Trump Administration’s environmental rollbacks this week, so we thought now would be the perfect time to check in on the President’s progress on his stated commitment to “return the agency to its core mission: Providing cleaner air, water and land to the American people.”
As of today—and as a respiratory pandemic rages on—oil and gas companies are no longer required to report methane emissions. Air pollution in national parks and wilderness areas is far more permissible. The Department of the Interior has carved pervasive new borders into national parks to allow for drilling. And the federal government will no longer take steps to reduce its carbon footprint, nor require itself to account for climate impacts such as rising sea levels when developing costly new infrastructure.
A proposed ban on chlorpyrifos, a pesticide linked to developmental disabilities in children, has been rejected. Coal companies are permitted to dump mining debris into our local waterways. Just this week, the EPA decided against limiting the use of perchlorate, a dangerous chemical in U.S. drinking water linked to severe health complications in people of all ages. And the day after the 2020 Presidential election, formal withdrawal of the U.S. from the Paris agreement will become official.
The silver lining? Many of the Administration’s attempts to weaken protections for our land, air and water have been challenged in court. Polls show that a majority of Americans are increasingly concerned about protecting our environment and mitigating climate change. And our opportunity to reverse these rollbacks with our activism at the ballot box is just a few months away.
