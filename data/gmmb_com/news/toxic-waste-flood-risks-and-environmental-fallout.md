**Hot Topic: Toxic mess.** When a massive industrial wastewater reservoir threatened to collapse in Manatee County, Florida after a tear appeared in its lining last weekend, hundreds of families were forced to evacuate their homes and told to brace themselves for a catastrophic and toxic flood. The reservoir—owned by private industrial corporations since 1970 and abandoned when the nearby Piney Point plant closed in 2001—holds 480 million gallons of water laced with phosphorus, nitrogen, ammonia and other toxic byproducts.


The pit had been leaking two to three million gallons of the contaminated water *per day* since March 26, and a full-blown collapse of the entire reservoir was looking unavoidable. Miraculously, workers were able to avert such a breach, which would have inundated miles of homes and businesses with toxic sludge—by diverting 170 million gallons of the slurry into Tampa Bay. And because crews are still working to repair the initial lining tear, a steady stream of toxic water continues to flow into Bishop Harbor, a nearby aquatic preserve. This invasion of Florida’s waterways threatens to spark widespread and harmful algae blooms that could deplete oxygen in the water, cause mass die-offs of fish and other sea life, and pose a credible threat to industries that sustain Florida’s economy, including fishing, boating and tourism.


Unfortunately, this imminent threat is not unique. There are an estimated 670,000 wastewater pits across the U.S., and a 2019 report found that at least 60 percent of them are vulnerable to collapse, particularly as climate change fuels increasingly frequent and deadly storms. And with communities of color 75 percent more likely than whites to live in neighborhoods impacted by industrial activity, cleaning up these sites is a matter of environmental justice.


Last week, President Biden announced a $20 billion plan to remove highways that run through low-income communities and communities of color, which will help reduce inequitable exposure to toxic emissions. While the administration has not yet announced a commitment to cleaning up wastewater reservoirs, incoming EPA Administrator Michael Regan led North Carolina’s effort to hold Duke Energy accountable when one of their coal ash pits breached in 2014. With his background in demanding greater corporate accountability and recent directive to prioritize environmental justice within the EPA, Regan is well-suited to spearhead a national push to find a permanent solution to the threats posed by these toxic wastewater pits.
