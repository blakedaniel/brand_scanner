***The Climate, Health & Equity Brief is GMMB’s take on the week’s news on the current impacts of climate change. If you haven’t subscribed yet, you can do so by [clicking here](https://mailchimp.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=f2f8c4bdabe1a2a83f914e813&id=4a13a601e2).***


**Hot Topic: Burning up.** As grim images from space reveal, New Mexico’s Calf Canyon/Hermit’s Peak fire continues to tear through the state. The largest wildfire in the state’s history, Calf Canyon/Hermit’s Peak has eclipsed the size of the city of Los Angeles and is currently the most substantial fire in the United States.  Unfortunately, it is just one of 731 wildfires currently raging across the U.S.—and summer has not yet even begun.


While you may think this is a problem for Western states alone given their arid conditions, think again: An unprecedented new Washington Post analysis shows just how much more pervasive climate-fueled fires are becoming across the entire nation.


The analysis examined factors such as worsening climate conditions, historic weather patterns, fire behavior models and ignition indicators to calculate the wildfire risk faced by every property across the U.S. and found that *half* of all addresses in the lower 48 states—which house one in six Americans—now face “significant” wildfire risk.


The report revealed that as climate change exacerbates drought and temperature rise nationwide, safe havens are growing increasingly rare. Wildfire risk is increasing even faster than flood risk, with states as far east as Georgia and South Carolina among those with the most homes and buildings threatened by fires.


What’s more, the communities that already bear a disproportionate burden of climate impacts and environmental injustice are now also at greatest danger from wildfires. More than 42% of the U.S. Native American population lives in areas with significant fire probability. The same is true for nearly 25% of the U.S. Hispanic population—and a majority of residents within these communities can’t afford to move, lack wildfire insurance and face job insecurity, which dramatically complicate their ability to recover after a devastating fire.


The analysis concludes with a grim warning: In the next few decades, many people will face even greater danger than they do now, and areas that are traditionally not considered wildfire-prone will soon become so without significant and urgent action to slow the effects of climate change.  To determine the specific wildfire risk in your zip code, be sure to check out the tool in the Kicker below.

A new *Washington Post* [analysis](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2022/wildfire-risk-map-us/?itid=sf_article_list) utilizing First Street Foundation’s [fire risk model](https://firststreet.org/risk-factor/) illustrates the widespread, severe and accelerating wildfire risk across the U.S., with estimates suggesting a staggering one in six Americans now live in areas with significant fire risk. (The Washington Post)


A new [study](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022GH000603) estimates that the U.S. could prevent more than 50,000 premature deaths and provide $600 billion in health benefits annually by reducing [energy-related emissions](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2022/05/16/climate-change-air-pollution-saved-lives/) from transportation, industrial activities and building functions such as heating and cooking.

A new [progress report](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(22)00090-0/fulltext) published in *The Lancet Planetary Health* revealed that globally, government attempts to reduce the [death and disease](https://grist.org/science/9-million-people-die-worldwide-pollution-each-year/) associated with pollution have largely failed, with wildfires and fossil fuel emissions causing an estimated 6.5 million deaths per year. (Grist)


India and Pakistan are now expected to experience extreme heat events once every three years—which is [100 times more likely](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-61484697) than the once every 312 years that was considered normal prior to the escalating impacts climate change, according to a new study.

Experts warn that the [eastward migration](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/5/16/u-s-wildfire-dangers-seen-spreading-east-as-climate-risks-grow) of wildfires is a given in the US as climate change intensifies, threatening the Midwest and the east coast with a significant increase in the coming years. (Al Jazeera)


In 2021, Earth and its oceans broke four [ominous records](https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/climate-change-records-2021-rcna29354)—reaching the highest levels ever recorded of greenhouse gas concentrations, sea level rise, ocean heat and ocean acidification—according to the World Meteorological Organization’s  State of the Global Climate 2021 [report](https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/four-key-climate-change-indicators-break-records-2021).

#### Equity


Experts warn that a “doom loop” of deepening debt and declining environmental conditions is imminent for the world’s poorest nations unless wealthier countries provide [climate reparations](https://grist.org/equity/debt-cancellation-climate-change-reparations/), including sweeping debt cancellation to developing countries, which are responsible for the least emissions by far but bare the greatest climate impacts.

[Apple farmers](https://news.trust.org/item/20220513154155-uh7x3/) in Indonesia are adapting to rising temperatures and prolonged rainy seasons, with some seeking cooler climates at higher altitudes while others are abandoning apples altogether to grow crops that are more climate appropriate.

#### Action


Climate-conscious consumers will soon be able to easily identify the [carbon impact](https://news.trust.org/item/20220513151006-3wtmb/) of the food and cosmetics they purchase, as more companies are adding carbon labeling—an indication of the carbon footprint involved in the product’s ingredients, manufacturing, shipping and end use—as part of their packaging.  (Thomson Reuters Foundation)
