**Hot Topic: Uninhabitable.** Research out this week underscores several ways in which parts of the globe could become “uninhabitable” within our lifetimes unless we take immediate action to drastically reduce emissions. One study warns that the world’s tropical regions—which are home to 3.3 billion people—could become unlivable *within the next decade* unless temperature rise is limited to 1.5°C. As of today, we have already reached 1.1°C of warming. Passing the 1.5°C threshold would cause so-called “wet-bulb” temperatures, which factor in humidity, to surpass average human body temperature and prevent humans from cooling themselves by evaporating sweat.


Adding to this threat, new data out this week revealed that nearly two-thirds of the world’s tropical rainforest has been degraded or completely destroyed due to logging, clear-cutting and other land development activity. In 2019 *alone*, the rate of forest loss matched that of the 20 previous years, amounting one football field of forest loss every six seconds.  More than half of this destruction has taken place in the Amazon and bordering rainforests and can be attributed in part to the devastating policies of conservative Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, who was elected in 2018 and has severely weakened environmental enforcement in the region. The destruction of earth’s forest—which is a major carbon-storing sink—is a significant contribution to planet-warming emissions, and the degraded land presents major risks to wildlife, which in turn exacerbate threats to the health of humans and the planet.


Yet another report underscores the impact of warming temperatures on hurricane activity. Though scientists have long attributed storm variability in the Atlantic Ocean to naturally occurring oceanic cycles, the report found that human-induced, industrialization-driven climate change may in fact be the real driver. As temperatures continue to rise, this has major implications for future weather patterns. Last year’s U.S. hurricane season broke virtually all records, and there is every indication that a continued rise in planetary temperatures will only lead to even more extreme and deadly storms.


Finally, a fourth study out this week shows what it will take to curb these growing threats. In 2020, global COVID-19 lockdowns resulted in a seven percent drop in emissions. That decrease must now be achieved every two years between now and 2030 to limit warming to between 1.5°C and 2°C—a tall order as the entire planet considers how to build back better following the global pandemic that has claimed more than 2.6 million lives.
