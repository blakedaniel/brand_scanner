**Hot Topic:** **Convergence.** Several troubling reports released in recent days show the devastating impact increasing heat is having on our planet’s bodies of water. First, scientists examining 150 years of temperature data warn that a vital ocean current system could be in trouble.


Scientists say that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)—the current system that distributes heat throughout the Atlantic Ocean and helps regulate climate and weather patterns around the globe—is at its weakest point in 1,000 years. Melting Arctic ice has resulted in an influx of cold freshwater that has weakened the current, which experts say could completely collapse this century without significant emission reductions. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), such a collapse would result in severe changes to the climate system and pose a critical threat to global food security.


What’s more, Florida’s reef system appears to be in crisis as soaring water temperatures trigger severe coral bleaching. Water temperatures up to 93°F have accelerated coral deterioration along the Florida coast, with one site investigated by researchers in recent days showing “100% coral mortality,” sparking fears of a broader threat to the biodiversity, coastal protection, carbon sequestration and economic benefits that healthy coral reefs provide to coastal areas.


And the world’s ocean isn’t the only body of water at risk. Scientists say that wetlands, which serve as natural ecosystems as well as repositories for toxic pollution from industrial waste and agricultural runoff, are now considered “timebombs,” with many now highly vulnerable to wildfires that could release hundreds of years of dormant toxins and pose a serious risk to human and environmental health.


Despite the dire news, many with the power to alter the trajectory of the climate crisis continue to abdicate global leadership. This week, climate ministers from the G20 countries—which together are responsible for nearly 80% of global emissions—failed to reach consensus on curbing emissions or scaling up renewable energy, effectively leaving the countries “nowhere” in their pursuit of climate action. The failed talks come just a week after the G20 energy ministers failed to reach an agreement on phasing down fossil fuels—an untenable situation as devastating climate impacts inch closer to reality.
