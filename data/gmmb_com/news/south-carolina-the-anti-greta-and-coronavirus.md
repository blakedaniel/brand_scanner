**Hot Topic: Representation.**As Black History Month draws to a close, voters in South Carolina are set to go to the polls on Saturday for the first-in-the-South Democratic primary. South Carolina has a 27 percent black population—among the highest in the nation—and the state has been ravaged by the impacts of climate change. The city of Charleston flooded *one out of every five days* in 2019, according to the National Weather Service, with many African American neighborhoods paying a disproportionate price.


Despite this, not one question from the moderators of Tuesday’s South Carolina presidential debate focused on climate change, a fact that has outraged high-profile activists and drawn criticism from candidates. Martin Luther King III has called upon South Carolina voters to consider candidate positions on climate change as they head to the polls tomorrow, citing the frequent flooding, poor water quality and increased rates of asthma that have ravaged many black communities in the state.


In a far different kind of activism, 19-year-old German YouTube influencer Naomi Seibt has been hired by the White House-aligned Heartland Institute to serve as the “anti-Greta” face of its efforts to spread climate denial among the world’s youth.  She makes her American debut this week at the Conservative Political Action Committee (CPAC) conference, alongside speakers that include President Trump.
