Climate, Health and Equity Brief Intern Insights: Takeaways from Our 2019-2020 Interns
April 30, 2020
 
School: The George Washington University
Hometown: Washington, D.C.
Team: Education and Traffic Safety
Most memorable account/project that you worked on: WRAP (Washington Regional Alcohol Program) Holiday “Checkpoint Strikeforce” was an awareness campaign to encourage people to not drink and drive during the holiday season. I was able to assist with the earned media push and in this role, my team members allowed me to work independently on pitching and securing media coverage. It was amazing to see all my hard work come to fruition.
Any particular advice from a fellow GMMBer that has stuck with you: “Never be afraid to ask for help, you are only one person.”
Favorite “Only at GMMB” moment: U.S. Congressman Max Rose visiting the office and having a chat with us in the café.
 
School: Central Washington University
Hometown: Des Moines, WA
Team: Seattle
Most memorable account/project that you worked on: Supporting the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation’s work in Washington state—working on projects that pertain directly to my community has been so rewarding.
Favorite movie and show you’ve seen recently: 
Movie: All the “Star Wars” films—I recently watched them all for the first time!
Show: “Tiger King”—need I say more? That show is just so wacky.
Three Instagram pages everybody should follow:
@cheapoldhouses: This account highlights historic fixer-upper homes for sale all over the country, and their bio describes it best—the most architecturally-intact rabbit hole you’ve ever fallen down.
@michelleobama: Because, Michelle Obama.
@orangeisthenewblackandtan: Phin is an orange tabby cat with cerebellar hypoplasia, which makes him a wobbly but otherwise happy and healthy cat! Serious cuteness overload.
School: University of Iowa
Hometown: Coralville, Iowa
Team: Paid Media
 Most memorable account/project that you worked on: I helped track the highly contested presidential primary race. We recorded and summarized media spending that took place in an unprecedented competition between potential Democratic Presidential nominees.
Favorite movie or show you’ve seen recently: “Abstract” on Netflix. It’s an awesome look into the daily lives of some of the most world-renowned designers and creatives. The show dives deep into how they have used their unique creative processes to develop their work over the years and achieve such high regard.
Favorite “Only at GMMB” moment: Halfway through my internship getting hired on full-time and switching to a team that will automate aspects of the previous intern position that I held.
School: Virginia Tech
Hometown: Woodbridge, Virginia
Team: Digital Strategy
Most memorable account/project that you worked on: The community outreach on behalf of FEMA focusing on hurricane and flood survivor stories.
Three Instagram pages everybody should follow: 
@MattDoesFitness: A well-known fitness personal trainer, influencer, and funny guy.
@wsj: Explore quick on-the-go content from trending articles and events.
@FoxNews or @CNNpolitics: Be informed by following accounts from both sides of the aisle.
Any particular advice from a fellow GMMBer that has stuck with you: “Branch out from your team and have lunch with as many people as you can. Building a network here will last a lifetime.”
School: University of San Francisco
Hometown: Palo Alto, CA
Team: Climate and Public Health
Most memorable account/project that you worked on: Working on our team’s Climate, Health & Equity Brief has definitely become my favorite ongoing project. It’s helped me increase my knowledge and understanding of the climate space as well as given me a chance to improve my writing!
Favorite movie and show you’ve seen recently: It’s not the most recent movie I’ve watched, but I love Lady Bird (and Saoirse Ronan)! I also love the TV show The Good Fight, but I’m currently very behind in watching.
Any particular advice from a fellow GMMBer that has stuck with you: My supervisor told me early on in my internship that each project was only going to be as enjoyable and as fulfilling as I chose to make it. Approaching each of my assignments with this mindset helped me see the big picture significance and benefits of everything I was doing, regardless of how simple or “small” they appeared to be at face value.
College/University: The George Washington University
Hometown: Old Lyme, Connecticut
Team: Paid Digital Media
Most memorable account/project that you worked on: I loved helping plan and execute a digital media buy during the 50th anniversary of Earth Day for an environment organization. Delivering climate action messages feeds my soul.
Favorite lunch spot near the office: Neopol Savory Smokery. Go for the salmon BLT!
Three Instagram pages everybody should follow:
@barbie_pond_ave_q: A local installation that uses a townhouse front yard to build topical scenes with Barbie dolls. From their insta bio: “Lowering Logan Circle property values since 2014.”
@mrsdowjones: Financial advice packaged as celeb gossip—essential content for any yopro with debt.
@PATreasury on Twitter. A criminally underrated government agency account that sets the bar for creating engaging content around their subject matter.
Thank you to all of our incredible interns. We appreciate all of your hard work and can’t wait to see how you’ll continue to create real and lasting change in the world!
