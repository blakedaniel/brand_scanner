**Hot Topic:** **Unprecedented.** An intense and widespread heatwave has gripped India and Pakistan in recent weeks, blanketing the region in some of the highest temperatures ever recorded on Earth for April. Land-surface temperatures reached as high as 140°F, and more than 1 billion people—the vast majority of whom have no air conditioning—have now endured temperatures over 100°F for weeks on end.


While South Asia is a region known for high temperatures, this event has hit differently.  Such prolonged, extreme heat in the region is “unprecedented” in March and April. Dozens of people have been reported dead of heat-related illness, though experts believe that number is vastly underreported. Schools have been forced to cancel classes, toxic landfills are catching fire, and staple crops are at risk of failing amidst a global food shortage. And in areas where the intense heat is coupled with high humidity, the combination risks raising the so-called “wet bulb” temperature to 95°F—the level at which the human body can no longer gain any cooling benefit from sweating and begins to shut down.


While India already gets 70% of its power from coal, demand for electricity has been so high in recent weeks that the government has halted passenger train service to free the tracks for additional coal shipments to power plants, which of course will further exacerbate emissions. Historically speaking, however, it is the United States, Europe (collectively), Russia and increasingly China that bear the greatest responsibility for the climate crisis, not the largely poverty-stricken populations now facing its most deadly and inescapable impacts.


Another unseasonable and tragic event currently plaguing the planet is the Calf Canyon/Hermit’s Peak megafire in New Mexico, which has grown to nearly four times the size of Washington, DC, destroyed hundreds of homes and is only 20% contained as of this writing. An estimated 300,000 acres have burned so far this year in the state—more than the last two years combined—even though New Mexico’s fire season doesn’t peak until June.


Coinciding diabolically with these unseasonal events is a new and disturbing planetary record. Despite the pandemic and renewed country pledges to cut emissions, levels of CO2 in the atmosphere reached 420 parts per million last month, which is well above the 280-350 ppm scientists say is ideal for human life, certified as the highest level ever recorded, and estimated to be the highest in the last 4.5 million years.


Carbon dioxide lasts hundreds to even thousands of years in the atmosphere, and researchers say that recent year-to-year growth in our planetary CO2 concentrations is unprecedented. As a result, “unprecedented” no longer describes the extreme and deadly climate impacts that are increasingly becoming the new normal.

#### Human Health


The unseasonal and unrelenting heatwave in South Asia continues, with land surface temperatures reaching [140°F](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/05/02/ipcc-scientist-warns-india-pakistan-record-temps-testing-limits-human-survivability) in parts of India and the intense heat closing schools, destroying crops, straining energy supplies and ‘testing the limits of human survivability.’ (Common Dreams)


England’s University of East Anglia is among the first in the UK to start a campus program aimed at addressing [climate anxiety](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-61218933), including discussion groups to address hopelessness and an eight-week course on how to turn feelings of despair and anger into ‘hopeful action.’ (BBC)


#### Planetary Health


The [Calf Canyon-Hermit’s Peak fire](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2022/05/05/new-mexico-fire-disaster-biden/) in New Mexico—the largest so far this year in the U.S.—has grown to more than triple the size of Washington D.C. and threatened the evacuation of 15,000 homes despite the state’s fire season having yet to peak. (The Washington Post)


New [data](https://keelingcurve.ucsd.edu/) from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography revealed that atmospheric CO2 levels reached the [highest levels ever recorded](https://www.axios.com/2022/05/04/april-sets-record-highest-co2-levels?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newsletter_axiospm&stream=top) in April, with researchers estimating May will be even higher despite global efforts to reduce emissions. (Axios)


A recent investigation revealed that the U.S has become the world’s second-largest consumer of [Brazilian beef](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2022/amazon-beef-deforestation-brazil/?itid=sf_article_list)—purchasing over 320 million pounds last year alone—and as a result is a primary accomplice in the further clear-cutting of the Amazon rainforest for cattle ranching. (The Washington Post)


[Controlled burns](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/05/climate/wildfires-prescribed-burn.html) are becoming a less viable option to contain extended wildfire seasons throughout the U.S. as unpredictable rain patterns, exceptionally dry conditions and strong winds prevent officials from carrying out containment fires safely. (The New York Times)


A new [analysis](https://www.beyondplastics.org/news-stories/plastics-manufacturing-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions-are-plastics-the-new-coal#:~:text=The%20industry%20overall%20produces%20232,industry%20by%20the%20year%202030.) revealed that Americans recycled only around [6% of plastics](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/05/04/us-plastics-recycling-rate-drop/) in 2021—down nearly 3% compared to 2018—underscoring the need for consumer brands and governments to adopt policies that reduce the production and usage of plastics.

(The Washington Post)


Sixteen states, the District of Columbia and several environmental groups are suing the U.S. Postal Service for using “faulty assumptions and miscalculations” on environmental impact to justify an [$11.3 billion mail truck fleet purchase](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/04/28/usps-trucks-lawsuit/), 90% of which will be made up of gas-powered vehicles.
