**Hot Topic:** **Progress.** All eyes were on New York this week as the U.S. and China—the world’s two largest economies and most egregious carbon polluters—announced major plans to tackle greenhouse gas emissions during Climate Week.


First, President Biden announced a new EPA rule that will slash domestic use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) by 85 percent over the next 15 years. HFCs—super-pollutants that are primarily used for refrigeration and air conditioning—remain in the atmosphere for only 10-20 years, yet trap *thousands* of times more planet-warming heat than C02 during that time period. The new rule is being touted as a major step forward on climate that will reduce the equivalent of three full years of emissions from the entire U.S. power sector by 2050.


Next, President Biden announced that he will double U.S. funding to help developing countries tackle climate change. The new annual pledge—$11.4 billion per year, beginning in 2024—will help close the gap that currently exists between commitments from rich countries and funding they have actually delivered for climate change mitigation and resilience in the developing world. Biden’s plan still requires approval from Congress.


Finally—and in a move being touted as one of the most significant developments on climate this year—President Xi Jinping announced that China will no longer fund the development of coal-fired power plants abroad. Because China was the last significant funder of coal production in developing countries throughout Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia, the announcement essentially ends future public support for coal globally. The move is expected to halt $50 billion in Chinese financing for 44 planned coal plants, though it leaves room for more than 20 existing projects to continue and fails to address China’s plans to expand coal-fired power plants within its own borders.


In the face of a sobering report from the U.N. that calls out how far behind we are in curbing emissions globally, these moves are expected to provide much-needed momentum leading into global climate talks this November in Glasgow—talks that many consider the last, best hope to rally global leaders on climate before it is too late. With this week’s news dominated by life-threatening power outages, climate-fueled mosquito infestations, crippling drought and the far-reaching impact of raging wildfires, the progress could not come at a more critical time.

#### Politics & Economy


Chinese President Xi Jinping announced the country would no longer fund new [coal-fired power projects](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.cnn.com/2021/09/21/world/un-climate-change-speeches-intl/index.html__;!!HhhKMSGjjQV-!u6S42u7jq_zP54rOFl_ck-_4-TWpdkVV8kupYxKUgY54K5MDJiMmjrCzhEiJFFqD_48%24) abroad and will instead redirect its financing to clean energy projects, a major move for the world’s largest funder of coal projects.
