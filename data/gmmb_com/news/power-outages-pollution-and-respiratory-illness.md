Hot Topic: Extreme measures.  California’s wildfire crisis entered unprecedented territory yesterday as utility company PG&E cut power to nearly 800,000 homes and businesses.  The company says the move was necessary to protect against power lines sparking another catastrophic inferno like last year’s Camp Fire, which killed 85 people and destroyed 14,000 homes.
Incredibly, the outage is expected to last up to a week in some places, placing an enormous strain on people living and working in impacted areas.  And the hot, windy weather that forced the drastic move is predicted to intensify in the years to come as a result of the climate crisis.
There is no question that getting a handle on the deadly wildfires sparked by human activity is necessary. Emissions from California’s 2018 fires far eclipsed the gains the state made in reducing emissions the previous year, and exposure to toxic pollutants from fires raging in the Amazon has driven a 36% spike in respiratory hospitalizations among children in Brazil.
Without meaningful change to stave off the domino effects of a warming planet, health impacts, blackouts, and other extreme adaptation measures could very well become our new normal.
