**Hot Topic: Extreme measures.**  California’s wildfire crisis entered unprecedented territory yesterday as utility company PG&E cut power to nearly 800,000 homes and businesses.  The company says the move was necessary to protect against power lines sparking another catastrophic inferno like last year’s Camp Fire, which killed 85 people and destroyed 14,000 homes.


Incredibly, the outage is expected to last up to a week in some places, placing an enormous strain on people living and working in impacted areas.  And the hot, windy weather that forced the drastic move is predicted to intensify in the years to come as a result of the climate crisis.


There is no question that getting a handle on the deadly wildfires sparked by human activity is necessary. Emissions from California’s 2018 fires far eclipsed the gains the state made in reducing emissions the previous year, and exposure to toxic pollutants from fires raging in the Amazon has driven a 36% spike in respiratory hospitalizations among children in Brazil.


Without meaningful change to stave off the domino effects of a warming planet, health impacts, blackouts, and other extreme adaptation measures could very well become our new normal.

PG&E [has cut power to](https://www.sfchronicle.com/california-wildfires/article/PG-E-power-shut-off-257-000-Bay-Area-residents-14500945.php?utm_campaign=premiumsfgate_breakingnews_20191008&utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email) 800,000 customers in California to minimize the risk of wildfires from power lines.

According to the latest [California Green Innovation Index](https://www.next10.org/publications/2019-gii), California’s 2018 wildfires more than [wiped out all progress](https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2019-10-08/california-must-triple-its-pace-of-emissions-reduction-or-miss-its-2030-climate-goals) toward climate goals the state made in 2016 and 2017.

Thousands of California residents reliant upon oxygen tanks and other medical-related equipment will be at particularly [high risk](https://www.chicoer.com/2019/10/08/gaps-exposed-as-planned-outages-continue/) during PG&E’s power shut-off. (Chico Enterprise-Record)


[Toxic pollutants](https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/03/health/amazon-fire-children-breathing-intl-hnk-scli/index.html) from the Amazon wildfires are creating health concerns for Brazilian children, ranging from respiratory problems to increased cancer risk. (CNN)

**Equity**  

Extreme, weather-related [climate migration](https://www.ecowatch.com/climate-migration-2640810172.html?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1) is limiting education opportunities for young girls, as many are forced to leave school to take care of their siblings or work to support their families. (EcoWatch)


The UN Food and Agriculture Organization has pledged to work directly with Pacific Island nations and small island developing states to improve agriculture and nutrition in the face of [extreme weather events](https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/10/1048552) that have increased their reliance on processed, imported foods.

(NPR)


**Politics & Economy**  

A new [study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0222317) has found that 84 percent of Mexico’s [most important fisheries](https://www.edf.org/media/84-mexicos-most-important-fisheries-be-impacted-climate-change-unless-action-taken) are at risk as climate change reduces populations of red snapper, mahi-mahi, pacific sardine, jumbo squid, abalone and snook.

A new poll shows that a majority of registered voters support [aggressive climate policies](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/10/5-most-popular-radical-climate-policies/599272/), including the creation of national recycling programs and large spending packages to transition to renewable energy sources.

New York protesters participated in the “[International Rebellion](https://grist.org/slideshow/why-extinction-rebellion-is-occupying-an-nyc-park/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=beacon)” on Monday, staging a funeral procession for the earth in the middle of Wall Street and promoting climate change education.
