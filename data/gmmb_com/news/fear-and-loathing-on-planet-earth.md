**Hot Topic: Playing with fire.** As California and parts of the South reel from extreme weather events this summer, a number of announcements by the Trump administration are set to increase harmful emissions and exacerbate the effects of climate change. In just the latest rollback of environmental protections, Mr. Trump’s EPA has chosen to ease requirements for treating coal plant wastewater prior to disposal, allowing harmful toxins into U.S. waterways and drinking water sources. The Bureau of Land Management also introduced a new rule significantly cutting the cost of leases to mine on public lands. And the Trump administration is now aiming to eliminate key environmental review processes and public notice requirements to open U.S. national forests to oil and gas drilling.


In Louisiana and Texas, excessive heat and humidity dealt another blow to hundreds of thousands of residents still without power after Hurricane Laura. In the predominantly Black and low-income community of Mossville, Louisiana, an industrial facility fire sparked by last week’s hurricane released dangerous levels of chlorine into the air, which can cause serious respiratory complications. And in Texas, a newly publicized report revealed that before Hurricane Laura even made landfall last week, oil and gas refineries released a whopping four million pounds of extra air pollution to clear their pipes ahead of the storm.


In California, the SCU and LNU Complex fires, which make up the second and third largest wildfires in the state’s history, have caused burn scars to Earth so massive that NASA was able to capture them from space. To make matters worse, health officials are warning that uncharacteristically dry conditions expected in California through the fall could leave smoke lingering in the air for months to come. The state is now bracing for yet another heatwave, with some forecasts predicting record-breaking temperatures that could worsen already dire fire conditions.


As Bill McKibben noted in *The New Yorker* this week, there are 25 parts per million *more* CO2 in the air now than there was in 2010. That’s more human-caused change in ten years than in the previous 7,000 combined. If environmental protections continue to be compromised in favor of the fossil fuel industry, the conditions plaguing California, Louisiana and Texas today are almost certain to become a dangerous new norm.
