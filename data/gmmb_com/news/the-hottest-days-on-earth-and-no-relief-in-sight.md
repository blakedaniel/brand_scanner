**Hot Topic:** **The scary new normal**. Summer 2023 is proving to be another one for the record books, with relentless extreme heat making life miserable for billions. Analysis of global temperatures revealed that the first week of July was likely the hottest “ever” recorded on Earth — meaning the hottest since the interglacial period some 120,000 years ago.


Death Valley, CA is projected to reach a scorching 131°F in the coming days, but traditionally sweltering locations are not alone in their suffering. A massive bicoastal heat dome has covered 15 U.S. states, resulting in 100 million people being placed under heat advisories and warnings, some with no relief in sight.


And the climate situation is exacting a tragic human toll. A study in Nature Medicine found that extreme heat led to more than 61,000 deaths in Europe last summer—more than any year in recorded history. Another study by the Center for American Progress estimates that exceedingly high temperatures will create $1 billion in health care costs and require nearly 235,000 emergency department visits in the U.S. this summer alone, with the urban poor expected to be hardest hit.


Unfortunately, extreme heat is not alone in wreaking havoc this summer. Devastating floods have torn through the Northeast U.S. and parts of Japan, Turkey, China, and India, taking lives, displacing tens of thousands of people and sweeping away homes, businesses, and critical infrastructure. And Canada’s record wildfires continue to multiply and burn, spreading toxic air to cities in the U.S. Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest, with more than 19 million acres of carbon-absorbing forest destroyed to date.


Despite this reality, Republicans continue their efforts to block climate action in Congress, and given the domestic tumult of the last several years, just 8% of Americans identify climate change as the most pressing issue facing the country today.
