**Hot Topic:** **Fired up and melting down.** For many this week, America does not look or feel like the country that has long considered itself the world’s most successful bastion of representative democracy. Between the exposé of a former President’s brazen attempt to undermine the 2020 election and back-to-back Supreme Court decisions that expand gun rights in the wake of yet another school shooting and end the national right to personal reproductive freedom, our nation feels unmoored.


Unfortunately, the forecast on the U.S. approach to the global climate crisis appears equally as grim. Within days, the Supreme Court is expected to issue another pivotal ruling—one that would severely limit U.S. federal authority to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, one of the most significant contributors to climate change. The case, West Virginia v. the EPA, is the result of a “coordinated, multiyear strategy” by Republican officials, conservative funders and the oil and coal industries to sacrifice the planet at the altar of profit.


What’s more, many of the 200 U.S. federal judges appointed nationwide by the former Trump administration are now poised to rule on further climate action cases across the country in the months ahead. As *The New York Times* notes, conservative rulings in these cases could stop the federal government from significantly restricting tailpipe emissions, considering the impacts of climate change when evaluating new infrastructure projects or requiring the replacement of power plants with wind and solar power.


Coupled with the impending Supreme Court ruling on carbon dioxide, these restrictions—in the country that is far and away the most historically responsible for the climate crisis—would seriously impede the world’s ability to meet crucial climate goals.


We know what must be done. Stand up. Speak out. Volunteer on swing-district campaigns where rights hang in the balance Get loud. Stay resolute. And above all, VOTE. If we work hard enough, we can force that pendulum to swing once again.

Recent rulings from Ecuador’s highest court have emboldened [indigenous tribes](https://longreads.trust.org/item/Ecuador-Amazon-rainforest-indigenous-gain-legal-ground-miners-drillers) to defend and preserve their lands in the Amazon forest—the world’s largest carbon sink—from illegal mineral and oil extraction.

In the coming days the [Supreme Court](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/19/climate/supreme-court-climate-epa.html) is expected to limit the ability of the federal government to limit CO2 emissions from U.S. power plants in an anticipated ruling that is the product of a multiyear conservative campaign to weaken the executive branch’s ability to tackle climate change.
