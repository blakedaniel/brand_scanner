**Hot Topic: Carbon neutrality.** Oil and gas took a hit around the world this week as evidence shows that a shift away from fossil fuels continues to gain steam in multiple sectors.
The UK announced that it will ban the sale of all non-electric cars by 2035 in an effort to slash emissions from the transportation sector. British newspaper *The Guardian* has banned ads from oil and gas companies on principle, despite the impact the move is likely to have on the paper’s bottom line.  And in Denmark, Ørsted—a company once responsible for *one-third* of the country’s entire carbon footprint—is now on track to become the first carbon-neutral utility in the world as it rapidly scales up its wind power business and converts its last remaining coal plant to biomass.
In the world of finance, European sustainable investment funds swelled by 56% in 2019, demonstrating a clear shift toward green investment options among consumers. And in the US, even Jim Cramer, fiery television host of CNBC’s Mad Money, declared fossil fuels “dead” as major oil and gas companies posted disappointing fourth-quarter earnings.
One place oil and gas received top billing this week?  President Trump’s State of the Union Address, in which he avoided any mention of climate change and credited his aggressive rollback of environmental regulations with a boom in domestic fossil fuel production.
