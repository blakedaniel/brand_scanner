**Hot Topic: Necessary choices.** History will note what this year’s UN International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Report lays bare: We have both the knowledge and the tools to curb emissions and avoid cataclysmic global warming—and if we fail to do so, it will be due to a lack of collective and individual will.


Global temperature rise is now set to exceed 1.5°C (2.7°F) within just 10 years—a situation the IPCC says is “unequivocally” due to human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. The report states that without deep emissions reductions, cataclysmic scenarios beyond 3°C (5.4°F) of warming this century are much more likely, with immense risks to humanity.


With each passing year that emissions continue, the necessary solutions grow in intensity and difficulty. Decades of inaction have denied us the luxury of a gradual transition to a more sustainable economy and society: The panel reports that even limiting warming to less than 2°C will require “deep, rapid and immediate” efforts across all sectors and warns that any time spent beyond the 1.5°C threshold will make the gradual reduction in global temperature more difficult to achieve due to unlocked feedback loops.


Despite the bleak outlook, the report notes that energy transition policies and technologies are making a real, meaningful difference. In some regions, wind and solar energy are now cheaper than fossil fuel use. In the past decade, many countries have proved it is possible to cut emissions significantly while still growing their economies. And despite the inequitable impacts of climate change, efforts like the UN’s loss and damage fund could result in the world’s richest and most developed nations assisting poorer nations with just solutions.


The climate crisis now demands that we, like the world’s governments, reflect on our choices in this critical period—including but not limited to the way we eat, travel, consume and vote. As IPCC chairman Hoesung Lee noted, “the choices we make now and in the next few years will reverberate around the world for hundreds, even thousands, of years.”
