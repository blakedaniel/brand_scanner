The Climate, Health & Equity Brief is GMMB’s take on the week’s news on the current impacts of climate change. If you haven’t subscribed yet, you can do so by clicking here.
Hot Topic: Potential. As leaders begin to ease shelter-in-place restrictions, they have an unprecedented opportunity to build a greener post-pandemic world. Cities are closing streets to vehicle traffic to make room for social-distancing pedestrians, companies are embracing remote work, and nature is seeing a resurgence, even in big cities. Leaders of government and industry can use this disruption of the status quo to plan for the future with public health—and the health of the planet—in mind.
To this end, Germany provides a model for transition. Two decades ago, the country and its municipalities began a shift away from fossil-fuel electricity with a host of forward-thinking policies. Those efforts paid off with hundreds of thousands of renewable energy sector jobs—and Germany now generates 43 percent of its electricity from renewable sources, compared with just 17.5 percent in the United States.
One study out this week found that 10 existential threats to humanity—climate change, environmental decline and pandemic disease among them—are interrelated and must be tackled together. So far, 15 U.S. states and dozens of municipalities have implemented 100 percent clean electricity goals that promise to do just that. Will COVID-19 prove to be the devastating wake-up call that sets the world on a more responsible path? Only time—and our level of commitment and activism—will tell.
