**Hot Topic:** **Heating up.** While the nation watched in awe as Mother Nature devastated parts of Yellowstone National Park, extreme weather of another kind was also playing out across a wide swath of the country. Record-shattering temperatures have plagued more than 100 million Americans from California to the Carolinas over the last two weeks, setting new record highs in 16 cities, prompting countless heat advisories and forcing multiple schools with sub-standard air conditioning to opt for distance learning.


With the last seven years the hottest in recorded history and severe heat waves now occurring regularly, scientists are drilling down on the ways that an increasingly warm world threatens human lives and health. And many are finding that the compounded impacts of extreme heat—currently the deadliest weather threat in the country—are clearer and more troubling than ever.


Research shows that in addition to causing heat stress and heat stroke, extreme temperatures are increasingly associated with organ failure, cell damage, impaired motor function, premature aging of the body, anxiety, depression and suicide. And the risks aren’t equal. Children, senior citizens, those with chronic health conditions and the poor are particularly vulnerable—as are those who earn their living outdoors.


A recent study from the Desert Research Institute reveals the disproportionate danger facing outdoor laborers in the U.S. Southwest, for whom years of experience working in the heat actually proves to be a disadvantage. In fact, the study—which analyzed outdoor workforces in Arizona, California and Nevada—made the surprising discovery that those who had held outdoor jobs for more than five years faced the greatest risk of health impacts, likely due to accumulated exposure to heat stress over time.


Research also indicates that extreme heat plays an insidious role in amplifying gender-based violence. An analysis of 41 peer-reviewed studies found that harassment, sexual violence and physical violence against women increase during and following extreme weather events, likely because they act as an amplifier to other drivers of conflict, including mental stress, economic instability, and food insecurity.


Unfortunately, the worst is yet to come if the world fails to move quickly to cut emissions. A new study published in the journal *Nature* found that the Arctic is heating at a rate seven times faster than the global average, with the most rapid changes documented in the North Barents Sea. Scientists warn that the loss of sea ice in the region will begin to set off a feedback loop that increases warming, exacerbates sea-level rise and triggers extreme weather events—including increasingly severe heat—across the globe.

#### Human Health



Scientists conducting a wide range of studies are increasingly linking [extreme heat](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/13/climate/extreme-heat-wave-health.html?campaign_id=54&emc=edit_clim_20220614&instance_id=64019&nl=climate-forward&regi_id=98536749&segment_id=95095&te=1&user_id=073e4527d1769e2d4ff3f23e1da5c6b4) with higher rates of kidney failure, cardiovascular collapse, organ and cell damage, impaired motor function, premature aging of the body, anxiety, depression and suicide. (The New York Times)


The worst drought in four decades is compounding the global food crisis across the Horn of Africa, destroying crops, draining rivers and wells, killing livestock and putting nearly 20 million people in Somalia, Kenya and Ethiopia at risk of [death by starvation](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/11/world/africa/somalia-drought-hunger.html). ( The New York Times)


Researchers at the Desert Research Institute (DRI) warn that the outdoor workforce in the U.S. Southwest is at high risk for heat-related [illness and injury](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/06/13/extreme-heat-las-vegas/?utm_campaign=wp_post_most&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&wpisrc=nl_most&carta-url=https%3A%2F%2Fs2.washingtonpost.com%2Fcar-ln-tr%2F3716de3%2F62a75e80956121755ab685b2%2F59725f55ade4e21a847bf6dc%2F31%2F72%2F62a75e80956121755ab685b2) beyond heat stroke, including vomiting, loss of strength, and severe headaches, with workers on the job five years or longer at the highest risk. (The Washington Post)


New [research](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(22)00088-2/fulltext) has found that women worldwide are more likely to experience [gender-based violence](https://www.businessinsider.com/climate-change-exacerbates-gender-based-violence-new-study-finds-2022-6)—including sexual assault, domestic violence and human trafficking—after extreme weather events, which exacerbate traditional drivers of violence such as economic instability, food insecurity and mental stress.

#### Planetary Health


Images of the [unprecedented flooding](https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/14/us/yellowstone-national-park-closed-visitors-flooding-tuesday/index.html) in Yellowstone National Park shocked the nation this week as water runoff equivalent to nearly three months’ worth of rain inundated the region in just three days, setting off mudslides, destroying roads and bridges, flooding local towns, tearing homes from their foundations and forcing the park to close for the first time in nearly four decades. (CNN)


A new [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-13568-5) has alarmed scientists with findings of [“extraordinary heating”](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/15/new-data-reveals-extraordinary-global-heating-in-the-arctic?utm_medium=email&utm_source=pocket_hits&utm_campaign=POCKET_HITS-EN-DAILY-SPONSORED&FINMASTERS-2022_06_16&sponsored=0&position=4&id=c3f5a644-fa4c-4af6-8765-25d6c0cee02a) in the Arctic, with the North Barents Sea now heating at more than twice the speed previously understood by scientists and seven times faster than the global average—a situation they warn is a frightening sign of what’s to come for the broader Arctic region.  (The Guardian)


A new [study](https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S0964569122001624?token=49440E2C7BAAB39D30E975D1E86292ED7A7819654F08F13F832F6C7F879A82190CD8B9BC8DE52F17314EA1A6C7E12118&originRegion=us-east-1&originCreation=20220616175022) warns that nearly [200,000 homes](https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/sea-level-rise-homes-coastal-erosion-b2101359.html) and businesses across coastal England are at risk of loss to sea level rise-related flooding by 2050, with tens of thousands of additional homes at risk of loss due to coastal erosion.  (The Independent)

California’s ancient [Sequoias](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/06/14/sequoia-trees-threatened-climate-wildfires/)—the world’s largest trees, some of which have stood for more than 3,000 years—are struggling to survive amid increasingly frequent massive and intense wildfires, with nearly 20% of the giants lost to fire in the last two years alone.  (The Washington Post)
