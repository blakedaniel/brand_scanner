The Climate, Health & Equity Brief is GMMB’s take on the week’s news on the current impacts of climate change. If you haven’t subscribed yet, you can do so by clicking here.
Hot Topic: Things heat up. President Biden struck a deal Thursday with a bipartisan group of 10 senators that will invest $579 billion in new funding into fortifying American infrastructure, including but not limited to roads, broadband internet and electric utilities. While the agreement is a significant step forward and includes $47 billion for climate change resilience, President Biden has said he will not sign the measure unless it is accompanied by a companion—and much larger—reconciliation package, which Democrats will likely need to push through without Republican support.
While the details of the eventual plans are being hashed out, nearly 48 percent of the lower 48 states are currently experiencing one of the most severe droughts in recorded history. In just one frightening example of its impact, Lake Mead—the massive reservoir formed by Hoover Dam that supplies electricity and water to 25 million Americans—has fallen to just 37 percent capacity, with no end in sight to the current drought.
The historically dry conditions are being compounded by the intense heat wave currently stifling the American West. Just this week:
Palm Springs, California hit 123 degrees, its highest recorded temperature;
Phoenix, Arizona reached 118 degrees earlier in the year than ever before, prompting construction workers in the city to speak out about their fears of passing out or dying on the job;
Doctors warn that people could get third-degree burns from contact with asphalt in Arizona and Nevada;
The temperature reached a record 105 degrees in midwestern Omaha, Nebraska, buckling the pavement on some metro-area roads; and
This weekend, heat 15 to 30 degrees above average is expected to hit the normally temperate Pacific Northwest during what is anticipated to be one of the longest-lasting and most extreme heatwaves in the region’s recorded history.
Scientists have warned that unless the world makes drastic cuts to greenhouse gas emissions, the number of extremely hot days in the U.S. could triple within decades. And the punishing heat is not just a U.S. problem. Ground temperatures topped 118°F this week in the Arctic Circle and normally frigid Siberia—a region where increasing temperatures threaten to melt the permafrost and release harmful, long-sequestered methane back into the atmosphere. And a new UN report says that drought could be “the next pandemic” if countries do not properly take action on water and land management to address the climate emergency.
As U.S. lawmakers deliberate about historic investments to fortify U.S. infrastructure over the coming months, we can only hope the fact that the inescapable impacts of a changing climate weigh heavily on their minds.
