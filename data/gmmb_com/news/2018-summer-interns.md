**From the Intern Desk: Summer 2018 at GMMB**


Over the past nine weeks, our 18 summer interns came together and learned what it means to create lasting change in the world. They made a positive impact on every department while growing as communicators along the way. At the end of a memorable summer, we asked our interns to share some advice based on their experience. What would they say to the future interns of GMMB?



Our interns came from all across the country, each bringing their knowledge, personality, and passion to the firm. We caught up with them to hear about some of their takeaways from this summer.

My supervisors, assistant account executives [Natasha del Amo](https://www.gmmb.com/team#!bio=natasha-del-amo) and [Annie Adair](https://www.gmmb.com/team#!bio=annie-adair), have been incredible.

When my local representative from Maryland spoke at one of our weekly staff meetings, I was moved by her story and how she has never backed down as a woman in government. After her speech, we spent a few minutes talking and she left me with her phone number. Now, I’ll be her intern in Annapolis next spring when the session starts up again!

The biggest challenge I had during this internship was the learning curve of balancing client work with several different projects going on at once. It’s important to prioritize and work closely with your project managers.

It is inspiring to see every member of the agency bring such a strong passion and sense of purpose to work every day.


 


**Any particular advice from a fellow GMMBer that has stuck with you?**


The phrase “The glory is in the details” is used all the time around the creative department, especially by my supervisor, [Serrin Ransom](https://www.gmmb.com/team#!bio=serrin-ransom). It has stuck with me as a daily reminder that no detail is too small to be worth the time it takes to get it right.

**What is your advice to an intern moving to DC for the first time?**


DC’s coffee scene is super cool, so if you have the time, skip Starbucks and go find a cup somewhere special!


 


**What’s the last book or podcast you’ve finished?**


I just finished book four of my annual re-read of the *Harry Potter* series. Don’t ask me how many times I have read those books (I’ve lost count).

**Cassidy Alla** | School: Vanderbilt University | Team: Digital


 


**What is the most valuable thing you’ve learned from your fellow interns?**


Working on a team is often the best way to be creative. I’ve always preferred working solo in the past, but on our summer-long intern project, all our best work has come from meetings where we bounce ideas off each other, joke around, and talk about our lives. I couldn’t have come up with half the amazing work we accomplished this summer on my own.


 


**What is the coolest opportunity you’ve had this summer through GMMB?**


Seeing Jennifer Palmieri (former communications director for the Obama White House and the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign) speak at a staff meeting! It was amazing to hear her speak in such a small venue; I was able to shake her hand and ask her questions. She was straightforward, funny, and inspirational.

I love observing their interactions with clients. They both ask hard questions that get to the heart of clients’ needs.


 


**What is your advice to an intern moving to DC for the first time?**


Visit each and every museum in the city. They’re all equally wonderful in their own way.


 


**What’s your favorite spot in the office?**


The Park meeting room. It has comfy couches and a great view overlooking Georgetown Waterfront Park.

**Michael Bryan** | School: Ballard High School | Team: Research and Planning


 


**What is the most valuable thing you’ve learned from your fellow interns?**


Patience is a virtue. When everyone has ideas they’re passionate about, it’s important to truly listen to what other people say. Then give yourself a minute to wait, internalize, consider, and adjust your idea to compromise and thrive!


 


**Any particular advice from a fellow GMMBer that has stuck with you?**


You are here to learn—soak everything in, and see if this is the right thing for you.

My fellow interns have taught me that work is better with people who are warm and supportive! I’ve been spoiled at GMMB with some of the nicest people I’ve worked with in my professional career.
