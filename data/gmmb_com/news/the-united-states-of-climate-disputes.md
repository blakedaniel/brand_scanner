**Hot Topic: Turbulence.** Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) and House Republicans spent this week doing everything in their power to hobble the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).


In the House, Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) negotiated the narrow passage of a debt ceiling bill that eliminates most clean energy tax credits and slashes billions of dollars earmarked for pollution reduction, energy efficiency and environmental justice previously passed in the IRA. And in the Senate, Joe Manchin (D-WV)—who single-handedly held up the sweeping climate policy last year—announced this week that he would support the repeal of the IRA he personally negotiated unless President Biden makes good on the fossil fuel investments in the bill, which he has accused the president of slow-rolling.


Despite the headwinds, the White House continues to push forward. This week, President Biden announced an additional $1 billion contribution to the Green Climate Fund to finance clean energy and climate change resilience in developing countries. He also pledged $500 million to assist Brazil with their efforts to end deforestation in the Amazon, though the contribution requires congressional approval—an uphill battle given how hostile the House Republican majority is to climate investment and action.


On the domestic front, President Biden announced the creation of the White House Office of Environmental Justice to address the fact that low-income and non-white communities suffer most from environmental hazards. And the EPA is expected to announce emission limits on U.S. power plants that will put the country on track to reach net zero by 2050 if implemented, though they are almost guaranteed to face a legal battle from a group of Republican attorneys general that has already sued the Biden administration to stop other climate policies.
