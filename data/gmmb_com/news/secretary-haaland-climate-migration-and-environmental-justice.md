Hot Topic: Historic appointment. Last week the Senate confirmed Hon. Debra A. Haaland as Secretary of the Interior. The appointment is a critical move toward policy change to combat the climate crisis and strengthen protections for humans and the environment. Secretary Haaland, who has a distinguished background in fighting to protect public lands and transition away from fossil fuels, will now lead the department that oversees land use policies, steers wildlife preservation efforts and decides how natural resources are extracted.
Secretary Haaland—a member of New Mexico’s Laguna Pueblo tribe—is the first Indigenous American in history to be appointed as a U.S. Cabinet secretary. The feat is more than just symbolic, as the Interior Department upholds the federal government’s commitment to tribal communities, including addressing environmental impacts on their lands. Indigenous people have been disproportionately exposed to soil and water contamination and other health impacts from fossil fuel activity. In the western U.S., more than 600,000 Indigenous people live within six miles of an abandoned mine, and pollution at these sites has been linked to increased rates of diabetes, childhood leukemia and cardiovascular disease. Sec. Haaland has a deep understanding of how oil pipelines threaten sacred Indigenous lands and provides a long-missing perspective at the highest levels of the federal government.
Game-changing Cabinet appointments are not the only way the Biden administration is addressing environmental injustices. An unprecedented $100 million of the COVID-19 stimulus package is earmarked to address fossil fuel pollution in low-income and minority communities, which have faced higher cases and deaths from COVID-19. And under recently appointed Administrator Michael Regan, the EPA now highlights environmental justice as a top priority and has restored public access to climate facts and data at EPA.gov.
With a new report this week revealing that climate-induced extreme weather events have displaced more than 10 million people globally in just the last six months, swift action to reduce carbon emissions and increase climate resilience is fast becoming an imperative. Secretary Haaland’s confirmation is one way that those who have been historically under-represented will now have a voice in the highest levels of government.
