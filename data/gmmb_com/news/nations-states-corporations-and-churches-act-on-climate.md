**Hot Topic: Commitments.** Just when the world needed some good news, leaders from the public and private sectors announced a wide range of initiatives this week that signal a heightened commitment to sustainability.


As part of its $146 billion economic recovery plan, Germany will require all gas stations to provide electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in an effort to boost demand for electric vehicles. Nevada pledged to adopt California’s strict air pollution laws and joined more than a dozen states in requiring that cars meet higher fuel efficiency standards than required by the Trump administration. And New York launched a $10 million grant program to increase access to solar energy and energy storage systems for low-income residents and communities of color.


In the private sector, retail giant Amazon announced a $2 billion Climate Pledge Fund to support innovations to reduce carbon emissions. The Climate Pledge—which was co-founded last year by Amazon in part to help address its own massive footprint—commits signatories to achieving carbon neutrality throughout their operations by 2040. And ridesharing company Lyft announced that it will transition to a 100 percent electric fleet by 2030 and has pledged to use its influence to advocate for greater EV incentive policies, negotiate with auto manufacturers to reduce EV prices and work to expand charging infrastructure.


And in the faith community, the Vatican is urging the world’s 1.2 billion Catholics to divest from the fossil fuel industry and support commitments to protect the environment.


Such action by nations, states, corporations and religious institutions are vital to addressing climate change, and they provide an example for other leaders to follow in pursuit of a cleaner, healthier and more equitable future for all.
