The Climate, Health & Equity Brief is GMMB’s take on the week’s news on the current impacts of climate change. If you haven’t subscribed yet, you can do so by clicking here.
 
Hot Topic: Health. Research out this week provides new evidence on the negative health impacts of fossil fuels. One report from the University of Chicago identified poor air quality as the single greatest risk to human health, finding that exposure to particulate matter cuts average life expectancy by two years for every woman, man and child on Earth. Among the world’s most polluted countries, the impacts are even worse; in some areas of India and Bangladesh, poor air quality has been found to shorten the average lifespan by nearly a decade.
In the U.S., a Union of Concerned Scientists study found that accelerating sea-level rise has put more than 800 coastal Superfund sites—the ‘worst of the worst’ hazardous waste sites in the U.S.—at heightened risk of inundation. If flooded, these sites would contaminate surrounding land and water with dangerous levels of toxins and cause adverse health effects among those living in surrounding and downstream neighborhoods.
A third study out of Columbia University provided some positive news with its examination of the impact of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) on children’s health. The research found that since its inception, the RGGI—a program that limits power plant emissions in 10 states—has prevented an estimated 500 cases of childhood asthma, 150 preterm births and 100 cases of autism.
While the mountain of evidence on the importance of clean air continues to grow and the world contends with a deadly respiratory pandemic, the news also reveals continued efforts to play politics with the air we breathe. Just this week, a GOP lawmaker was arrested for accepting a bribe to secure a billion-dollar bailout for a fossil fuel company, and an investigation of the Trump administration is now underway for allegedly allowing the Department of Transportation, rather than the EPA, to write new U.S. emissions standards.  We find ourselves longing for the days—particularly those in the future—when sound science and a concern for human health guide our elected leaders’ decisions.
