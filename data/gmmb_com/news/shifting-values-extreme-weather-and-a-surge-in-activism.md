Climate, Health and Equity Brief Shifting values, extreme weather and a surge in activism

The Climate, Health & Equity Brief is GMMB’s take on the week’s news on the current impacts of climate change. If you haven’t subscribed yet, you can do so by clicking here.
Hot Topic: Waking up. New survey data out this week shows that Americans are nearly four times more likely to be alarmed by climate change than to deny it. With extreme weather events breaking records across the country, this shift in the country’s attitude should come as no surprise. Just this week, Phoenix, Arizona had its 144th day of temperatures at or above 100°F, breaking its own annual record. At 288 days into 2020, this means that Phoenix has faced blistering heat for half the year.
A new report from the UN further underscores the evidence of a changing climate, revealing that there were 7,348 extreme weather events in the decade from 2000 and 2019, nearly double the 4,212 that occurred in the two decades prior—a four-fold increase in deadly heatwaves, monster storms and wildfires in recent years. Yet another study this week found that climate-related disasters could cost the global economy $20 billion annually by 2030 unless substantial measures are taken now to reduce disaster risk and exposure.
Thankfully, activism across sectors continues to increase. As evidence continues to show the effects that a heating planet has on human health, the American Medical Association is pushing to ensure that climate curriculum is taught to medical students and included in hospital residency programs. Kaiser Permanente—the first health care consortium to achieve net-zero emissions—has developed a guide to help other hospitals and health systems do the same. And the Pope has taken to TED to deliver a visionary talk on the actions we must take to protect the planet we call home.
Even in the midst of a job market stunted by COVID-19, job seekers are choosing to stand up for the environment. More than 600 law students from 45 schools have pledged to boycott massive international law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison unless it removes ExxonMobil as a client. The decision signals a continued expansion of tactics among climate advocates to pressure companies abdicating responsibility for protecting our planet.
