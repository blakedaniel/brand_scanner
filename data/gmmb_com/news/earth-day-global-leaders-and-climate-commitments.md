**Hot Topic: Ambition.** In honor of Earth Day, the White House is currently hosting 40 world leaders in an unprecedented, two-day virtual climate summit. Convening just three months after President Biden symbolically re-entered the U.S. into the Paris Agreement on his first day in office, the event is meant to help the U.S. regain its leadership role at the forefront of global climate action and encourage greater climate ambitions from the world’s largest economies. Among its day-one highlights:


* President Biden introduced a new target to cut U.S. carbon emissions by 50-52 percent by the end of the decade compared to 2005 levels—a far more aggressive goal than former President Obama’s 2015 pledge of up to 28 percent and Trump’s withdrawal from that commitment.
* President Biden also announced a substantial increase in the amount of climate aid the U.S. will offer to developing countries, pledging to reach around $5.7 billion a year by 2024—double the amount offered by the U.S. annually between 2013 and 2016.
* Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga pledged to reduce emissions by 46 percent compared to 2013 levels, emphasizing a transition away from fossil fuel-powered electricity and greatly strengthening the country’s previous target of a 26 percent reduction.
* Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau committed to reducing the nation’s emissions 40-45 percent by 2030, expanding its past goal of 30 percent in the next decade.
* Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro announced a new target to make Brazil carbon neutral by 2050, pledging to end illegal deforestation by 2030 as a way to meet that goal—though many are skeptical of these vows, as deforestation has surged under Bolsonaro’s presidency.
* British Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiled perhaps the boldest emissions reduction target, announcing a goal to slash carbon emissions in the U.K. by 78 percent by 2035, compared to 1990 levels. Johnson aims work with Parliament to enshrine this new target into law by summer.


Beyond national commitments, the event has been notable in its scale and its speakers. Discussions explored the intersections of climate change and national security, innovation, finance and more, bringing together representatives from nations, corporations, universities and indigenous groups. With an expansive view of the crisis and experts speaking to solutions, the summit has underscored the necessity of working across borders, oceans and cultures to solve the greatest challenge of our lifetimes.


And yet, the most substantial challenges still lie ahead. China—by far the world’s leading emitter, with double the carbon emissions of the U.S.— failed to offer enhanced carbon reduction commitments. The same is true for India, the world’s third-largest CO2 emitter behind China and the United States.


Even among the world leaders doubling down on the need to tackle this global crisis, it remains to be seen how these ambitious commitments will play out. In order to meet its new climate goals, the U.S. must radically transform its reliance on fossil fuels, requiring new policies and increased federal spending on the infrastructure required to make clean energy the norm across the nation. As President Biden emphasized, responding to the climate crisis is a challenge, but also an opportunity to invest in the technologies of the future, and to create a world that is healthier and more equitable for the 8 billion people who call Planet Earth home.
