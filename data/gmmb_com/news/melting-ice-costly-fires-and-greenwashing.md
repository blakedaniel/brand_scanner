 Melting ice, costly fires and greenwashing

**Hot Topic: Heating up.** Two new reports out this week underscore the unrelenting environmental and economic impacts of global heating as a result of burning fossil fuels. The UN found that global greenhouse gas emissions hit record highs in 2019*—*levels that set the world on track for an average temperature rise of 3°C this century. The report is a sobering reminder that without a long-term, systemic shift away from fossil fuels, temporary dips in global emissions—such as those that resulted from global COVID-19 restrictions this year—will have little effect in curbing the worst effects of climate change.


A second report found that without major emission reductions, the Arctic could become a region defined more by ocean than ice and snow within 30 years. While emissions heat the entire planet, the light-deflecting ice in the Arctic is rapidly melting and uncovering darker, light-absorbing land and ocean beneath, leading to increased heat in the region—a feedback loop with cascading global impacts.


In economic news, a new study analyzing the impact of California’s 2018 wildfire season found that the damages cost the U.S. economy nearly $149 billion. This year, wildfires in the state have burned more than 4.3 million acres of land, nearly triple the amount in 2018.


In contrast, the economic opportunities of a transition away from fossil fuels are vast. Another major report this week revealed that achieving net-zero emissions in Europe by 2050 would lead to the creation of 11 million new jobs in developing sectors, for a net gain of 5 million jobs after accounting for losses in the fossil fuel industry.


And the shift away from fossil fuels is picking up steam. In the U.S., New York State announced that its $226 billion pension fund would divest from fossil fuel stocks over the next five years. And in Europe, the Danish parliament has voted to end all offshore fossil fuel activity by 2050, opting instead to invest in renewable energy sources like offshore wind.


Meanwhile, the Trump administration continues to rush through more environmental rollbacks in its final days, while Senate Republicans have introduced a bill championing tree planting as a singular solution to climate change. Though trees play a big role in absorbing emissions from the air, the plan relies on trees alone and ignores the urgent need for a systemic change away from the status quo if we are to have any hope of avoiding the worst impacts of climate change for humanity and the planet.
