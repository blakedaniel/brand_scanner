The Climate, Health & Equity Brief is GMMB’s take on the week’s news on the current impacts of climate change. If you haven’t subscribed yet, you can do so by clicking here.
Hot Topic: Tipping point. A stunning new study out this week revealed that 40 percent of the Amazon has reached a tipping point that could result in an irreversible shift from rainforest to savannah-like grassland. While scientists have long known that such a change was possible, it was thought to be decades away. Yet a number of forces have already set that change in motion, including unabated clearcutting for logging and farming and prolonged drought conditions and rising temperatures that have led to severe fires in recent months.
This change would destroy the natural habitat of a vast range of species and greatly diminish the Amazon’s role in absorbing carbon dioxide, which is vital to the health of our biosphere. What’s more, a recent analysis revealed that 13 major corporations that signed on to a 2010 initiative to eliminate their role in deforestation by 2020 are either far behind or no longer committed to achieving that goal.
Another major forecast by scientists this week warns that the number of climate-induced migrants within the U.S. will rapidly increase from the 2.1 million Americans forced from their homes between 2018 and 2019 due to increasingly severe, climate-induced weather events. Such events have only intensified this year, with total acres burned in California nearly equal to the land mass of Connecticut and Delaware combined.
Along the Gulf Coast, Texas and Louisiana are bracing for another life-threatening storm surge as Hurricane Delta approaches. When the storm makes landfall, it will be the 10th in the U.S. this season, setting a record for the most hurricanes to make landfall in the U.S. in one year.
In some welcome good news, major commitments out of Europe this week have set an example for leaders around the world. In a historic vote, the European Parliament has approved a legally binding target to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 60 percent in 10 years, a 50 percent increase to its previous goal of 40 percent. And British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced that he will invest more than $200 million to increase offshore wind capacity to 40 gigawatts by 2030. When completed, wind sources will produce enough energy to power all homes in the U.K.
