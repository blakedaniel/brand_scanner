 America: Under water, on fire and economically besieged

**Hot Topic:** **America under siege.** From destructive winds to torrential flooding and harrowing wildfires, tens of millions of Americans bore the brunt of a fresh string of climate-driven disasters across the country this week.


In the face of an already hyperactive storm season, Hurricane Ida wrought devastation from Louisiana to New York. Forceful winds damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes in the south, knocked out power to more than a million homes in New Orleans amid severe summer heat, and set off an extremely rare tornado in New Jersey that ripped several structures to shreds. Record-breaking Ida rainfall also triggered deadly flooding that inundated neighborhoods, roadways, and the New York City subway system.


Scientists confirm that Ida’s jarring impacts simply could not have been possible without the influence of climate change. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) confirms that rising ocean temperatures have created conditions ripe for intense storm activity, with parts of the Gulf of Mexico already 3-5°F higher than last-century averages. Storm systems draw their energy from warm ocean water, which in this case provided fuel for Ida to strengthen from a Category 1 to a Category 4 in less than 24 hours, packing 150-mph winds just in time to wreak havoc as it made landfall in the U.S.


Meanwhile, in California, six of the seven largest fires in recorded history have occurred in just the last 12 months. Intense heat and bone-dry terrain severely dehydrated by the state’s two-year drought have helped provide unprecedented fuel for these explosive blazes. Heat persisting overnight is also supercharging fire spread, and roads, highways, and other traditional fire breaks are failing to stop the flames. All told, 2,600 square miles of forest and land have already burned so far this year in the state, with the ever-growing fire season still underway.


Climate change deniers would be wise to take note that extreme weather events cost U.S. taxpayers nearly $100 billion last year alone—more than quadruple the average just three decades ago. Without rapid action and significant commitments to get our emissions in check, this economic devastation—among other deadly impacts—will only continue to grow.
