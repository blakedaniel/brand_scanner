With the results of the 2020 election clear, GMMB congratulated clients on their wins up and down the ballot in the most important election in our history, resulting in a White House victory and Democratic wins in critical races nationwide.


GMMB was the lead digital agency for Biden for America, helping President-elect Joe Biden and Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris score a historic victory over President Donald Trump. In so doing, GMMB spearheaded the largest Democratic digital program in history. GMMB Vice President [Megan Clasen](https://www.gmmb.com/team/megan-clasen/) ran the campaign’s digital advertising, Senior Vice President [Erica Monteith](https://www.gmmb.com/team/erica-monteith-2/) managed the $200-million digital advertising program, Senior Vice President [John Rimel](https://www.gmmb.com/team/john-rimel/) was a senior adviser to the campaign for paid media strategy, and Partner [Anson Kaye](https://www.gmmb.com/team/anson-kaye/) led GMMB’s creative work.


The firm produced creative that ran across platforms throughout the general election, worked closely with the campaign on planning and execution for digital outreach and persuasion, and developed an integrated advertising strategy to reach voters on TV, radio, out-of-home, and digital channels. By leveraging key moments — like the Emmys and the return of live sports — GMMB reached previously untargeted or neglected voters across 16 different states and 18 different audience segments. GMMB also deployed innovative new digital tactics such as counterprogramming to audiences who had previously seen misinformation presented in Trump ads.


Reaching traditionally disenfranchised voters and working for a diverse slate of candidates was also a core focus of GMMB’s political work this cycle. The firm helped to empower a diverse coalition of voters with creative that was representative of who they are and their lived experience. Led by Director of Data Science [Pedro Suarez](https://www.gmmb.com/team/pedro-suarez/) and Senior Account Executive Valentina Perez, GMMB’s media and creative teams developed culturally fluent ways to persuade and mobilize Latinx and African American audiences across traditional and digital platforms. Working with the Democratic National Committee (DNC), we implemented a first-of-its-kind voter education program that complemented local organizing efforts, countered voter suppression, and drove record turnout in battleground states. The firm also helped elect a dozen women candidates to both state and federal office, including Vice President-elect Harris’ historic candidacy, which GMMB worked on during both the primary and the general election.


All told, GMMB helped candidates and ballot initiatives win some of the most hotly contested races in the country, from state houses to the United States Senate. In so doing, GMMB was honored to work not only with our candidate clients but also major Democratic and cross-partisan organizations like the **Senate Majority Pac (SMP), the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), House Majority Forward (HMF), With Honor (WH), Planned Parenthood Maine Action Fund (PPMEAF), Maine Conservation Voters (MCV**), and **Rebuild Maine IE (RMIE).**
