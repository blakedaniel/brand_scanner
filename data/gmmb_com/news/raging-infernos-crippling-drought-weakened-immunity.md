**Hot Topic:** **Hell on Earth.** The American West is currently under siege, facing a range of nightmarish scenarios that are bringing the impacts of climate change into stark relief for tens of millions of people.


First, drought. Ninety (90) percent of the U.S. West is currently in drought, with conditions considered “severe” or “exceptional” in about half of the region, resulting in shrinking water supplies, devastated crops, desertified grazing lands and rapidly accelerating wildfires. While recent monsoons have provided some short-term relief in Arizona and New Mexico, Meteorologists at NOAA have issued the dire prediction that exceptionally dry conditions will last through late fall or even longer in most western states.


Next, wildfires. More than 41,000 fires have burned 4.5 million acres across the U.S. so far in 2021—and wildfire season doesn’t peak until October.  There are 99 large fires currently burning across 12 states, only six of which are contained.  More than 2.5 million acres are ablaze as you read this newsletter, with more than 26,000 firefighters deployed, many of whom are reporting fire speed and ferocity the likes of which they have never seen. Smoke from the fires is drastically reducing air quality, with readings from ‘unhealthy’ to ‘hazardous’ choking large swaths of California. In addition to scorching the earth and razing entire towns, a new study blames wildfires for nearly 20,000 cases and 748 deaths to COVID-19 in 2020, as the fine particulate matter in wildfire smoke has been closely associated with a lowered immune response to respiratory disease.


And finally, water shortages. In a historic first, the U.S. government has declared a water shortage on the Colorado River. Experts predict that Lake Mead—the river’s largest reservoir that provides water to 25 million people—will dwindle to just *34 percent capacity* by December. Beginning next year, Arizona will receive about 18 percent less water from the Colorado River than in a typical year, and Nevada’s water allowance will be reduced by about 7 percent. Farmers and crops will bear most of the initial burden, with 30 percent of the farmland in one Arizona County expected to be left unplanted next year, drastically impacting farmer livelihoods and potentially contributing to shortages and a spike in prices.


And of course, these devastating impacts are not limited to the American West. NOAA reports that July 2021 was the hottest month on record globally in *142 years* of record keeping, and a new Lancet study has found that deaths attributable to extreme heat have increased by 74 percent since 1980 worldwide, with causes ranging from heart failure and respiratory issues to suicide, drowning and homicides.


Yet despite these deafening alarm bells, climate change somehow continues to be a partisan issue. Many Congressional Republicans remain steadfastly opposed to emissions reduction efforts, claiming that a clean energy transition will harm the economy.  We fear that without a livable planet, there will one day be no economy left to save.
