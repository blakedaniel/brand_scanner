**Hot Topic: Science, not fiction.** Massive swarms of locusts are invading East Africa, devastating crops, causing human misery and threatening millions of people with famine and starvation. The United Nations estimates that one of the swarms is three times the size of New York City and contains *200 billion* of the creatures, which have a relentless drive to eat and reproduce. The infestation is creating a humanitarian crisis in communities that were already facing food shortages. Scientists say the swarms have been fueled by warming ocean waters, increased cyclones, and heavy downpours, and could continue to grow exponentially through June if left unchecked.
In southeast Brazil, unrelenting rains have caused torrential mudslides that have buried dozens of people alive, covered entire communities in sludge and left thousands of people homeless. While Rio de Janeiro faces particularly high risk for mudslides and the impacts of a warming climate only continue to intensify, state and federal governments have consistently failed to meet funding goals to adapt, leaving millions of people vulnerable.
These other-worldly events continue to show the devastating impact of a warming climate, particularly on the poor. In both Africa and Brazil, it is the most vulnerable populations that are at particularly high risk of starvation and homelessness. And so-called climate apartheid is also bearing out in places like Australia and the U.S., where those in power continue to deny the climate crisis while the poorest among us suffer the greatest consequences.
