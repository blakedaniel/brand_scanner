 Deadly heat, national security and nature’s disappearing act
============================================================

***The Climate, Health & Equity Brief is GMMB’s take on the week’s news on the current impacts of climate change. If you haven’t subscribed yet, you can do so by [clicking here](https://mailchimp.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=f2f8c4bdabe1a2a83f914e813&id=4a13a601e2).***


**Hot Topic:** **Sounding the alarm.** Several alarming developments this week shine a spotlight on the cascade of impacts attributable to our changing climate.  First, a sobering new report from the UN and the Red Cross warns that if we fail to keep global temperature rise well below 2°C, extreme heat events will make parts of Asia and Africa uninhabitable for up to 600 million people within decades, causing large-scale suffering and loss of life, massive population displacement and further entrenched global inequality.


The report urges large and targeted investment in climate adaptation and lauds the adaptive measures some agencies are already rolling out, such as emergency housing, cooling centers, “green” roofs, early-warning systems, training for first responders, and changes to school calendars—all of which are becoming increasingly necessary in some regions.


Next, the Biden Administration released its highly anticipated national security strategy this week, making clear that the White House views the climate crisis as one of the world’s greatest security threats. The strategy underscores the need to reduce energy dependence on hostile regimes like Russia and cooperate on climate talks with rivals, particularly China. It also warns—just as the UN report did—that global tensions will further intensify as countries compete for resources and face food insecurity, health threats, climate-fueled instability, conflict, and mass migration.


And yet, there is more. One new report finds that global wildlife populations have declined by 69% in the last 50 years—evidence that we are currently living through the largest loss of life on Earth since the time of the dinosaurs. Satellite monitoring shows that human-driven deforestation destroyed 562 square miles of forest in the Brazilian Amazon last month alone, a record for September. And in Alaska, officials canceled the winter snow crab season due to a 90% plunge in the crab population—or the loss of approximately 1 billion crabs—since 2020, which scientists attribute largely to warming waters and have called a “canary in a coal mine” for other species in the Arctic ecosystem.


Yet somehow, according to the latest Washington Post-ABC News poll, just half of Americans consider climate change “very important” or “one of the most important issues” in their votes for Congress this November, even as America’s commitment to climate action—and the desperate global need for it, given our position as the largest historical emitter on the planet—hangs in the balance.

#### Human Health



A new [report](https://www.ifrc.org/sites/default/files/2022-10/Extreme-Heat-Report-IFRC-OCHA-2022.pdf) by the UN and the Red Cross found that [extreme heat events](https://www.france24.com/en/environment/20221010-heatwaves-to-make-regions-uninhabitable-within-decades-say-un-red-cross) will result in a “large loss of life” and make parts of the world uninhabitable for up to 600 million people this century; authors also laid ways to limit the damage of [future heat waves](https://apnews.com/1f88316af736129a3732015824d86ef5), including “green” roofs, cooling centers, early-warning systems and more funding for local responders. (AP, France 24)


As the American West faces its worst drought in over a millennium, the small town of [Coalinga, California](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/10/10/drought-california-water-levels/) faces an uncertain future as its sole source of water—a federally managed aqueduct—is expected to run dry within two months. (The Washington Post)



#### Planetary Health


The biennial [Living Planet Report](https://livingplanet.panda.org/en-US/) found the Earth’s wildlife populations have [declined](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/13/almost-70-of-animal-populations-wiped-out-since-1970-report-reveals-aoe) by 69% in the last 50 years—evidence that we are currently living through the sixth mass extinction, the largest loss of life on Earth since the time of the dinosaurs. (Guardian)


[Deforestation](https://www.barrons.com/news/brazilian-amazon-deforestation-breaks-september-record-01665153006) in the Brazilian Amazon broke its monthly record for September, with an estimated 562 square miles of forest cover—25 times the size of Manhattan—destroyed last month alone, making it the worst September since monitoring began in 2015. (Barron’s)


A new [study](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022GL099955) found that [rain intensity](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/10/11/rain-increasing-climate-change-us/) is increasing across nearly every region of the U.S., confirming atmospheric scientists’ hypothesis that warmer weather leads to a wetter world due to the atmosphere’s increased ability to hold water.

#### Equity




New [research](https://rightsandresources.org/publication/funding-with-purpose/) finds that only 17% of annual climate funding designated for protecting Indigenous land is actually invested in Indigenous communities, leading to [skepticism](https://grist.org/article/the-world-spends-billions-to-protect-indigenous-land-only-17-goes-to-indigenous-people/?utm_campaign=fy23-timely-topical&utm_source=list-email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=october) among tribal leaders about the $1.7 billion pledged for their communities at the COP26 Climate Summit. (Grist)


As the smoke from the California wildfires spreads to Nevada, members of tribes and other rural communities that live in “care deserts” that [lack local access](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/10/09/climate-change-wildfire-smoke/8190406001/) to treatment are at elevated risk of lung disease from the hazardous air quality.
