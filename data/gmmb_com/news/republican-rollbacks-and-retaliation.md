**Hot Topic: Losing ground.** A major report released this week by researchers at Columbia and Yale offers a jarring look at the United States’ dismal progress in addressing the climate crisis. The Environmental Performance Index (EPI), which ranks countries on climate change performance, environmental health and ecosystem vitality, found that the U.S. plunged from 15th to 101st out of 180 countries on climate metrics, which researchers largely attribute to the wanton rollback of environmental protections by the Trump Administration.


Even without control of the White House, Republican lawmakers continue to derail U.S. climate efforts. With the midterm elections approaching—along with the prospect of a Republican-controlled House and Senate—details of a new energy and climate roadmap were unveiled by House Republicans this week. The plan fails to set specific greenhouse gas emission targets and calls for ramped up fossil fuel production, increased liquified natural gas exports and streamlined permitting for large-scale infrastructure projects—all moves that would further impede U.S. climate progress.


At the state level, Republican legislators across the country have launched coordinated pressure campaigns targeting climate-conscious companies. In West Virginia, state funding has been pulled from BlackRock—the world’s largest asset manager—for naming climate change an economic risk. In Utah and Idaho, officials have condemned a major ratings agency for considering environmental risks when assessing states’ creditworthiness. And in more than a dozen states, conservative leaders are setting wheels in motion to prevent state retirement and investment funds from doing business with companies committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.


Of the 180 countries evaluated by the Environmental Performance Index that have pledged to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, only Britain and Denmark are on track to actually achieve the target. Chillingly, many U.S. lawmakers seem set on ensuring our country never achieves anything close.

#### Human Health


A new [study](https://gh.bmj.com/content/7/6/e008860 "https://gh.bmj.com/content/7/6/e008860") published in the *British Medical Journal* warns that a new specialty in [climate cardiology](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-05-climate-cardiology-specialty-tackle-links.html "https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-05-climate-cardiology-specialty-tackle-links.html") is needed to address the growing impact of climate change on cardiovascular health, with scientists attributing an estimated 93,000 cardiac deaths globally to high temperatures in 2019.

#### Planetary Health


The biennial [Environmental Performance Index](https://epi.yale.edu/downloads/epi2022report.pdf "https://epi.yale.edu/epi-results/2022/component/epi") found that only two countries on the planet—Denmark and Britain—are on a sustainable path to becoming carbon neutral by 2050, and the U.S. dropped from [15th to 101st](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/31/climate/united-states-climate-ranking-trump.html "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/31/climate/united-states-climate-ranking-trump.html") place globally on climate mitigation due in large part due to Trump-era policies that rolled back or impeded progress.

#### Equity


The green transition is leading to concern within [Indigenous communities](https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/why-indigenous-peoples-are-key-ensuring-ev-revolution-doesnt-run-out-road-2022-05-31/ "https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/why-indigenous-peoples-are-key-ensuring-ev-revolution-doesnt-run-out-road-2022-05-31/") whose territories are home to a significant proportion of energy-transition metals, with 97% of nickel, 89% of copper, 79% of lithium and 68% of cobalt in the U.S. alone located within 35 miles of a Native American reservation.

Increased heat, prolonged drought and resulting water shortages are causing [tomato farmers](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/climate-change-is-coming-for-your-pizza-sauce "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/climate-change-is-coming-for-your-pizza-sauce") in California—where 90% of all canned tomatoes in the U.S. are grown—to cut back on their output, potentially reducing the availability and increasing the cost of America’s second-most consumed vegetable. (National Geographic)


#### Action


Scientists from 35 countries are working together on the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor—the world’s largest [fusion energy](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2022/05/world/iter-nuclear-fusion-climate-intl-cnnphotos/?position=7 "https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2022/05/world/iter-nuclear-fusion-climate-intl-cnnphotos/?position=7") project—which, if successful, could provide Earth with an unlimited zero-emissions energy resource without any long-life radioactive waste. (CNN)


The UN Development Programme is engaging a younger and more isolated audience through [video games](https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/05/1119292 "https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/05/1119292") that advocate, teach and engage players in climate change action. (UN News)
