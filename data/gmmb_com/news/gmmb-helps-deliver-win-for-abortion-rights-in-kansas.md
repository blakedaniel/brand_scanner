*Agency produced advertising for the “No” side in the first major victory for “choice and abortion rights” since Roe v. Wade was overturned*


**Washington, D.C.** – On August 2, Kansas voters delivered a decisive win for abortion rights and reproductive freedom in America. GMMB helped lead the messaging and strategy for the upset victory of the “No” campaign, which resulted in a 17% margin of victory for abortion rights advocates.


“Kansas just sent America a message: voters from both parties want their freedom and right to choose protected, and they don’t want politicians telling women what they can or cannot do with their bodies,” said **GMMB** **Senior Vice President and Managing Director Harper Lawson,**who has worked in Kansas politics for years and served as a chief strategist to the “No” campaign. “Kansans for Constitutional Freedom ran an impeccable campaign that led with Kansas voices. We were proud to partner with them and the entire consulting team to deliver this win.”


The agency served as the paid media firm for Kansans for Constitutional Freedom, producing 18 ads for broadcast, cable, Connected TV (CTV), Over-the-top-TV (OTT), and radio. GMMB also managed the media buying throughout the campaign. See examples of the advertising run [here](https://work.gmmb.com/project/kansans-for-constitutional-freedom-spots/).    


“What started out as a long shot became a stunning, upset victory,” said **GMMB** **Senior Vice President Jodi Quintero,**who oversees the firm’s electoral work on reproductive rights around the country and was also a lead strategist for the “No” campaign. “This was a huge win for Kansas and for the country. It’s clear women will not allow our rights to be trampled, and we’re not going backwards.”


GMMB’s team included Harper Lawson, Jodi Quintero, Isabel Giacomazzi, Amrutha Chatty, Andrew Hutson, Blakely Summerhays, Kyle McCormick, Georgia Zoller, Geneva Swanson, and Kaufman Butler.
