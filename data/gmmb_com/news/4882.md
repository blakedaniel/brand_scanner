**Hot Topic: The EPA.** Two studies out this week point to the ways the EPA is falling short on protecting our health.  First, experts reported that US air pollution rules could be ‘hugely insufficient’ in preventing deaths from PM 2.5—tiny, inhalable particulate matter that is 2.5 micrometers or smaller—most of which results from the emissions of power plants, industries, and automobiles. The study links PM 2.5 with nine causes of death—from heart and lung ailments to kidney disease and dementia—and finds that nearly all deaths resulted from PM exposure *below* current EPA guidelines.
Another report out this week found that climate impacts threaten 945 toxic waste sites overseen by the EPA.  The Government Accountability Office says hazardous waste from the sites will put nearby communities and water supplies at risk unless the EPA takes steps to fortify them against the increased flooding, wildfires and extreme weather that are virtually guaranteed as climate change intensifies.  The Trump Administration has rejected the warnings, saying current processes and resources at the sites are adequate.
Thankfully, many leaders are fighting back. This week, 22 states and three cities joined California in a lawsuit against the EPA over its efforts to deny states the right to set tailpipe emissions standards higher than those of the federal government, which California has done in an effort to combat air pollution and fight climate change. Governor Gavin Newsom also announced that the California government would stop buying vehicles from General Motors, Toyota, Fiat Chrysler and other automakers who have sided with Trump on the issue, introducing a new tool in the arsenal to protect the environment.
