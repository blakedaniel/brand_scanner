**Hot Topic: A global threat.** As leaders from the public and private spheres gathered in Davos, Switzerland this week for the annual World Economic Forum (WEF), the theme was climate and its impact on the economy. WEF’s annual Risks Report named climate change the biggest global threat to the future, and a range of environmental crises are expected to have major economic impact over the next decade.
The most salient risks identified by WEF include extreme weather events; the failure of governments to adequately prepare their communities for climate change; human-made environmental disasters, such as oil spills and radioactive contamination; biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse; and natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, and geomagnetic storms.
What’s more, a report issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) last week named climate change #1 of 13 urgent health challenges for the next decade, as climate change exacerbates malnutrition, spreads infectious diseases, and leads to air pollution that is linked to millions of deaths globally every year.
While alarm bells are sounding within global institutions and more companies are beginning to announce sustainability commitments, the corporate elite that attend Davos still has a lot of work to do. According to a WEF study published in December, only a quarter of a group of 7,000 businesses are setting specific emissions reduction targets, and only an eighth are actually reducing their emissions each year.
