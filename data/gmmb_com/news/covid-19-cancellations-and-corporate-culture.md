The Climate, Health & Equity Brief is GMMB’s take on the week’s news on the current impacts of climate change. If you haven’t subscribed yet, you can do so by clicking here.
Hot Topic: Pandemic. As COVID-19 grips the world and upends everything from neighborhoods and schools to governments and global industry, even the climate is not immune. Studies show that CO2 emissions have dropped by 25 percent in China, and further decreases are expected globally due to sharp reductions in air travel and daily transit around the world. Analysts say the reductions could lead to the first drop in global emissions since the 2008-09 financial crisis.
But the deadly pandemic is certainly nothing to celebrate—and the long-term impacts of the novel coronavirus on the climate fight are much more complicated. As a result of COVID-19 fears, critical Paris Agreement negotiations have been canceled, potentially delaying new national commitments. Oil prices have dropped sharply, imposing a financial strain that could cause some companies to reconsider large-scale investment in low-carbon technology. And in the face of plummeting profits, airlines are asking countries to halt the implementation of environmental taxes designed to reduce emissions.
Moving forward, one worry among experts is that countries could try to revitalize their flagging economies by subsidizing polluting industries, which could cause emissions to soar. One hope? That COVID-19 could spur a shift in corporate culture to more readily endorse remote work for those whose jobs allow it, which in turn would reduce transportation, oil demand and emissions over time.

“We’ve seen that governments can act, and people can change their behavior in a very short amount of time. That’s exactly what the climate movement has been asking governments and people to do for years in the face of a different kind of threat – the climate crisis – and we don’t see commensurate action.” 
– May Boeve, Executive Director of 350.org
