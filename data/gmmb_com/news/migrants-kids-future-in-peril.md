***The Climate, Health & Equity Brief is GMMB’s take on the week’s news on the current impacts of climate change. If you haven’t subscribed yet, you can do so by [clicking here](https://mailchimp.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=f2f8c4bdabe1a2a83f914e813&id=4a13a601e2).***


**Hot Topic:** **Global crises.** From the U.S. to South America and beyond, climate change is fueling a growing number of public health and economic crises and threatening the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people.


Here in the U.S., federal officials revealed that water levels are falling so quickly in Lake Powell that its hydroelectric power generation could become impossible as soon as next year. As the second-largest man-made reservoir in the nation, the lake distributes power to nearly six million homes and businesses spanning from Nebraska to Nevada when running at full capacity. It is also a critical source of drinking water and irrigation for millions living in cities, towns, rural farms and native communities in Arizona, California and Nevada. Amid the climate-fueled megadrought in the West—which has now persisted for 20 years—these projections illustrate how vulnerable our country’s vital infrastructure systems are to an increasingly warming climate.


And severe drought is not just a domestic issue. In Guatemala, punishing drought and prolonged heatwaves are just two of several extreme weather events that are devastating communities dependent on agricultural production to sustain their livelihoods. In fact, the UN has indicated that more than one-fifth of the country’s entire population is now food insecure due to climate-fueled extreme weather. As more and more families grow desperate, there are now tens of thousands of Guatemalans choosing to attempt the treacherous journey north to find respite in the U.S.


The same is true in Haiti, where political turmoil following the assassination of the country’s president and the effects of Tropical Storm Grace have left people facing such instability that many are now choosing to migrate. In just the past month, up to 40,000 migrants have attempted to cross the Texas border in hopes of a brighter future. And these migration patterns are not isolated. According to the UN, extreme weather events have pushed an average of 21.5 million people to migrate since 2010—with the vast majority coming from countries already struggling with political and social conflicts. As warming temperatures fuel even more frequent and intense disasters, these staggering numbers will only grow.


Tragically but not surprisingly, a new study released this week revealed that globally, children born during or after 2020 will face seven times more extreme heatwaves and twice as many droughts and wildfires as those born in 1960. Thankfully, a poll released this week found that 70 percent of Americans are now “very worried” or “somewhat worried” about the climate crisis—a ten percent increase in just the past six months—and that for the first time in history, a majority believe the climate crisis is impacting their lives “right now.”


While this data is heartening, empirical data and day-to-day realities continue to show that we are not moving quickly enough to avoid some of the worst impacts of the climate crisis—making the stakes for deliberations in Washington and abroad in the coming days and weeks more important than ever.
