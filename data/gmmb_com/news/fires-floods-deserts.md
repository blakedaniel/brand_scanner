**Hot Topic: Extremes.** Several developments this week continue to illustrate the wide-ranging effects that climate change is having on every corner of the planet.


Wildfires made worse by climate-fueled heat and drought continue to exacerbate planetary heating by releasing record amounts of carbon as they burn. A new report found that wildfires across Siberia, the U.S. and Turkey emitted an estimated total of 1.76 billion tons of carbon in 2021—roughly the equivalent of 1.34 billion passenger cars being driven for an entire year.


In Africa, more than 700,000 South Sudanese people–or 1 in 15—have been displaced from their homes by record flooding this year. Cases of malaria and other waterborne illnesses have surged. And the floods have wiped out vast swaths of harvest land and killed nearly one thousand cattle, driving a massive hunger crisis in which more than 60 percent of the population is considered at a crisis-level risk of famine, according to the World Food Programme.


And in global regions ranging from remote Russia and northern China to North Africa and the American Southwest, desertification is slowly overtaking areas that are home to half a billion people. In these regions, higher temperatures and drought combine with human practices such as deforestation and over-farming to leave the soil lifeless, devoid of moisture or nutrients, and unable to sustain crops or even grow grass for livestock.


In a spot of good news, President Biden issued a series of executive orders this week that commit the federal government to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, a transition that will be crucial to tackling the climate crisis. The orders set interim goals for the government to purchase only clean energy by 2030, cut building emissions in half by 2032, and purchase only zero-emission cars and trucks by 2035. Given the purchasing power of the U.S. government, observers are hopeful that a U.S. commitment to purchase cleaner products will help spur markets and accelerate the transition to green energy.  It can’t come a moment too soon.
