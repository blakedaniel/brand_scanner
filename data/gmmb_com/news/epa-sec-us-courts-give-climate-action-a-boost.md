***The Climate, Health & Equity Brief is GMMB’s take on the week’s news on the current impacts of climate change. If you haven’t subscribed yet, you can do so by [clicking here](https://mailchimp.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=f2f8c4bdabe1a2a83f914e813&id=4a13a601e2).***


**Hot Topic:** **Federal action.** As the world remains fixated on the humanitarian and democratic crises in Ukraine, several U.S. federal actions either taken or proposed this week are quietly taking aim at the climate crisis.


First, the EPA is proposing a plan that would restrict power plants and other industrial sites from creating unhealthy smog for millions of Americans who live downwind. The so-called “good neighbor” rule is designed to cut ground-level ozone, which is exacerbated by increased temperatures and can cause respiratory problems, particularly among children, the elderly and those with compromised health. The rule—which would be fully implemented by 2026 if approved—aims to improve air quality and human health while also encouraging industrial sites to convert to clean, zero-emitting power.


Next, the SEC is expected to propose a groundbreaking new rule on Monday that will require all publicly traded companies to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and the climate risks their businesses face. The move will represent the most significant change to corporate disclosure rules in more than a decade—and it reflects President Biden’s intention that the private sector account publicly for its contributions to the climate crisis.


Third, in a major win for the Biden administration, A federal appellate court ruled this week that the US government can once again factor the ‘social cost’ of greenhouse gas emissions into its regulatory decisions. President Obama set that cost at approximately $51 per ton of CO2 emissions, which the Trump administration then slashed to $1-$7 per ton to help its case for weakening climate change mandates. President Biden can now reinstate the cost to $51 per ton, which is a science-backed estimate of the economic cost of emitting each additional ton of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The sum has been referred to by some scientists as “the most important number you’ve never heard of,” as it informs billions of dollars of investment decisions annually and is considered critical to informing effective climate policy.


Finally, a federal appeals court rejected ExxonMobil’s effort to stop two states from probing whether the company suppressed research going back to the 1970s and lied to investors and the public and about the effects of climate change.  Following the ruling, the investigation into the company’s climate disinformation can now proceed. Given the highly precarious state of the world today, we will take all the good news we can get.

#### Human Health


A new [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28764-0) revealed that rising global temperatures are exacerbating ideal growing conditions for pollen-producing plants and trees, threatening to lengthen [annual allergy seasons](https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/15/us/allergy-pollen-season-getting-worse-climate-scn/index.html) by up to 40 days and intensify pollen concentrations by as much as 250 percent. (CNN)


A recent global [analysis](https://rmdopen.bmj.com/content/8/1/e002055) of more than 80,000 patients from 2016 to 2020 revealed that exposure to particulate matter from air pollution is linked to a nearly 12 percent increase in diagnoses for [autoimmune diseases](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/15/air-pollution-exposure-linked-higher-risk-autoimmune-diseases) including rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease. (The Guardian)


Scientists have sounded alarm that agricultural shortages already fueled by climate change and threatened by extreme weather—and now exacerbated by the war against Ukraine—could soon create a [global food crisis](https://www.eenews.net/articles/climate-and-russia-could-combine-to-create-a-food-crisis/).

A new [analysis](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220314-how-big-can-hailstones-grow) warns that as climate change increases atmospheric temperatures and levels of humidity, hailstorms are growing more violent and frequent—even in regions in which conditions have historically limited the formation of hail. (BBC News)


The economically and ecologically significant [beech forests](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/03/220316115010.htm) across Europe are at risk due to increased drought severity, with current models predicting a 30-percent decline in growth between 2020 and 2050, and at a time when the carbon-sequestering capacity of forests is more vital than ever.
