For the 107,000 children who are available for adoption in the U.S. foster care system, there aretwo very different paths—be adopted by a permanent family or age out without the care and support of a permanent, loving family.


In 2011, the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption asked GMMB todevelop a communications strategy to release research on the outcomes of its signature program,Wendy’s Wonderful Kids (WWK).The unprecedented, fiveyearresearch effort found implementing DTFA’s child-focused adoption recruitment model, leads to higher rates of adoption particularly among children traditionally seen as more difficult to find adoptive families. The research has been heralded among policymakers and adoption managers and practitioners as proof that all children are adoptable.


GMMB created an animated video—“Unadoptable is Unacceptable”— using kinetic typography to highlight these positive findings and to combat the misconception that some children in foster care are unadoptable.


This prestigious award joins a 2012 Gold ADDY Award for Electronic Broadcast, a 2012 Silver Telly Award, and best video production from Columbus American Marketing Awards.
