 Dire warnings, scorched Earth and the Senate acts

**Hot Topic:** **An uncertain future.**The U.S. Senate took two major steps forward on climate action this week with the bipartisan passage of a $1 trillion infrastructure bill followed by the party-line passage of a $3.5 trillion budget resolution, which together include more than $400 billion for a range of climate change mitigation and resiliency initiatives. Progress on this two-track strategy could potentially be derailed in the House, however, where Democrats hold only a three-vote majority and members from the progressive and moderate wings of the party are not seeing eye-to-eye on the way forward.


Meanwhile, an alarming report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released Monday confirms that climate change is “unequivocally” caused by human activity, a temperature rise of at least 1.5°C within the next two decades is locked in, and without immediate action to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and significant reductions even sooner, global average temperatures could increase by as much as 4°C, which would have devastating consequences for every region of the globe and every living thing on earth.


And while it’s only 2021, the world is already on fire. California is experiencing its second-largest wildfire in history, which has burned for a full month and is only 30 percent contained as it continues to reduce entire towns to ash. There have been 240 wildfires in Turkey, 300 in British Columbia and 600 in Greece in recent days. And the nearly 100 massive wildfires currently burning in Siberia are bigger than all others in the world combined. Firefighters are sounding alarm bells that the blazes they are contending with are demonstrating behavior they have never seen, feeding off of intense drought and extreme heat conditions to create their own weather patterns in addition to pyrocumulus clouds, dry lightning, and firenadoes.


We can only hope that the dire warnings from the IPCC and the shocking, scorched-earth images from around the world will inspire world leaders—and the U.S. Congress—to take the actions necessary before it is too late.
