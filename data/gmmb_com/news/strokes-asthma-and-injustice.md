The Climate, Health & Equity Brief is GMMB’s take on the week’s news on the current impacts of climate change. If you haven’t subscribed yet, you can do so by clicking here.
Hot Topic: Environmental injustice. As we approach one month since the Pacific Coast wildfires first began, health systems in the Western U.S. are reporting alarming surges in hospitalizations connected to poor air quality, including a 43 percent increase in strokes and other cerebrovascular incidents. Doctors also issued renewed warnings that prolonged exposure to smoke and ash-filled air could intensify asthma among children and increase pregnancy complications for expectant mothers.
Unfortunately, the health impacts of the wildfires don’t stop at air pollution. Straight from the “just what we needed, something new to worry about” department, hundreds of residents in California’s Santa Cruz mountains are currently under a “do not drink” advisory after fires melted much of the plastic piping in the area, contaminating the drinking water supply with benzene, a known carcinogen.
Still further developments this week underscore the fact that the burden of toxic pollution is not evenly shared. While many wealthier families have purchased expensive air purifiers or retreat to vacation rentals or second homes to escape wildfire smoke, those with lower-paying jobs and inflexible work conditions—including a disproportionate number of people of color—have been forced to stay put and contend with the multiple health complications posed by exposure to toxic pollution.
This particular scourge, of course, is not limited to the impact of wildfire smoke. Activists expressed outrage this week following the revelation that a gas plant owned and operated by the city of Los Angeles has been leaking methane for almost three years, polluting surrounding communities made up primarily of Latino and low-income families already dealing with some of the state’s dirtiest air.
Meanwhile, a new report from the American Lung Association found that just one change to our current practices—transitioning to a fully electric transportation system—could decrease U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 90 percent in the U.S. by 2050, illustrating just how much public health can benefit from ambitious climate action.
In good news, promises around climate action were on full display during this year’s virtual Climate Week, with governments and corporations alike announcing ambitious commitments to achieve carbon neutrality in the coming decades. The question is, will they be a case of too little, too late?
