**Hot Topic: America’s imperiled coasts.** The devastating fires throughout the American West have dominated news coverage in recent weeks, and understandably so. More than 42,500 fires have scorched nearly 7 million acres in the U.S. this year. California’s wildfire season is the worst in recorded history, with smoke now impacting air quality as far away as Europe and U.S. wildfire-related carbon emissions the highest in nearly two decades. Meanwhile, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Indonesia and Siberia have also experienced particularly devastating wildfire seasons this year, with the vicious cycle of climate change and deforestation to blame for much of the destruction.


Meanwhile, Hurricane Sally has devastated parts of coastal Alabama, Florida and Georgia this week, with record-setting rainfall and catastrophic flooding leaving at least one person dead, 550,000 without power and entire communities underwater. And in Greece, a rare Mediterranean hurricane made landfall this morning, bringing heavy winds and flash flooding that has led to significant property damage. While Sally alone has caused an estimated $3 billion in damage, four new tropical cyclones are already forming in the Atlantic Ocean, marking only the second time in recorded history that four or more storms have formed simultaneously. If they make landfall as expected in the coming weeks, up to 11 feet of storm surge could ravage the Southeast from Louisiana to Florida.


Climate science tells us these extreme and unprecedented weather events are no longer an anomaly. A new analysis warns that without sharply reducing our fossil fuel habit, these events could make parts of the Western and Southeastern U.S. uninhabitable within the next 45 years, forcing one in 12 Americans to migrate to more livable conditions elsewhere in the country. In addition to displacing tens of millions of people, this shift would almost certainly widen the existing gulf between the rich and poor, disrupt American farming practices and accelerate the urbanization of cities ill-equipped for the influx, leading to an America vastly different from the country we know today.
