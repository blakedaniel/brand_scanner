Climate, Health and Equity Brief Fiery destruction, debate chaos and signs of hope

The Climate, Health & Equity Brief is GMMB’s take on the week’s news on the current impacts of climate change. If you haven’t subscribed yet, you can do so by clicking here.
Hot Topic: Feeling the heat. Wildfires continue to rage through Northern California’s famed wine country as the region heads into a hot and windy weekend with no relief in sight. As of Friday, more than 66 square miles in Napa, Sonoma and nearby counties have been scorched and 350 structures have burned to the ground, including hundreds of homes and more than 20 historic wineries, restaurants and resorts. The impact on the wine industry has been described as nothing short of “catastrophic.”
A fire of a different kind raged at Tuesday night’s presidential debate. While the result was nearly unwatchable, there was one silver lining: Candidates addressed climate on the debate stage for the first time in 20 years. However, when asked about his belief in climate change and what he plans to do to confront it, Mr. Trump claimed “we now have the lowest carbon” and he wants “crystal clean air and water,” both despite the scores of devastating environmental rollbacks he has implemented since 2016. Just this week, Mr. Trump’s EPA finalized a rule that will ease restrictions on major U.S. polluters by reclassifying them as minor polluters and announced a legal challenge to California Governor Gavin Newsom’s signed executive order to end the sale of gas-powered vehicles in his state by 2035.
In welcome news, New Jersey state legislators have approved a first-in-the-nation ban on single-use plastic and paper bags as well as disposable food containers and cups made of polystyrene foam. The ban is an aggressive step toward eliminating packaging waste and reducing pollution that sets an example for other states to follow. Across the pond, Britain’s National Health Service (NHS) has pledged to become the world’s first carbon-neutral healthcare system by 2040. The NHS’s plans include reducing emissions from its supply chain and existing hospitals, building 40 new zero-emissions hospital buildings and transitioning to an electric ambulance fleet.
Finally, more than 64 world leaders have signed a Leaders’ Pledge for Nature, committing to transitioning their countries to sustainable economic systems, reducing global pollution and ending the dumping of plastics into oceans by 2050. Signatories describe the pledge as a “turning point” by which future generations will judge their willingness to act on environmental destruction. While the pledge is a major step in the right direction to tackle climate change and preserve our biosphere, many of the world’s biggest contributors to global greenhouse gas emissions—including China, India and the U.S.—are notably missing from the list.
