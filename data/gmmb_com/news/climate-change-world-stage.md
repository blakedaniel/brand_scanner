**Hot Topic:** **Olympic-sized impacts.** With the Summer Olympics underway in Tokyo, extreme heat in the region has garnered nearly as much attention as the athletic performances. So far, daily temperatures have ranged from the high 80s to low 90s, but consistently high humidity makes it feel more like 100°F. And the impacts of the heat on arguably the world’s healthiest individuals have been substantial. Russian archer Svetlana Gomboeva fainted after competing, several men’s triathlon competitors collapsed in the heat, Spain’s Paula Badosa had to forfeit her game after suffering heat stroke during her match, and officials have announced mandatory medical timeouts throughout tennis matches due to the risk of dehydration and heat stroke.


A May report from the British Association for Sustainable Sport found that the mean temperature in Tokyo has climbed by nearly 3°C since 1900—more than three times faster than the global average—but the threat of extreme heat is not isolated to Japan. With a continued global reliance on fossil fuels, scientists warn that rising planetary temperatures will make it impossible for all but a handful of cities around the world to host the Summer Games by 2085.


And the impacts of climate change this week extended far beyond Tokyo. Fires in the U.S. have already burned three million acres this year—an area the size of Delaware and Rhode Island combined. In Madagascar, the world’s first-ever famine caused solely by climate change has taken hold, leaving 1.5 million people in outright famine or facing food insecurity and forced to survive on cactus, wild leaves and locusts. In Siberia, more than 250 wildfires have resulted in what scientists have termed an “airpocalypse,” with air quality measuring 17 times worse than even world’s most polluted cities. And powerful monsoons near the Bay of Bengal have caused days of flooding and landslides, killing more than 160 people in India and damaging or destroying an estimated 2,500 Rohingya refugee shelters in Bangladesh.


In the face of intensifying climate-fueled disasters in every region of the globe, the urgent need to transition away from fossil fuels is clear. While agreement on a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure deal in the Senate this week is an important step forward, it still faces final votes in both the House and Senate, and the meat of the climate provisions are yet to come in a separate, $3.5 trillion bill Democrats hope to push through this fall over the objection of Republicans.


Meanwhile, G20 environment ministers ended their talks in Italy this week deadlocked on the phaseout of coal-fired power generation, thanks to countries including China, India, Russia, Turkey and Saudi Arabia objecting. The ministers will revisit the issue in October, just before the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. In the meantime, coal power plants are currently projected to increase by 3 percent globally and potentially reach an all-time high in 2022, showing that the stakes and need for decisive action during this Fall’s climate negotiations could not be higher.
