**Hot Topic: Communities at risk.** There is no shortage of news about the disproportionate toll COVID-19 is taking on low-income communities and people of color in the United States. The prevalence of underlying health conditions, proximity to pollution sources, the proportion of jobs that don’t allow for social distancing, and limited access to health care *all* play a role in increasing this vulnerability—not only to COVID-19, but also to the health impacts of climate change.
Data continue to show that air pollution not only intensifies global heating, it also makes respiratory issues like COVID-19 more deadly. In just one striking example, Louisiana’s St. James Parish—a predominantly African American district that is home to more than 150 chemical refineries—has suffered a COVID-19 death rate *five times higher* than the U.S. at large. Despite clear evidence linking pollutants to illness from similar hotspots across the country, President Trump’s EPA is allowing coal, oil, gas, and power producers to ignore pollution monitoring and reporting obligations, as long as they use economic impacts of COVID-19 as an excuse.
As Michael Bloomberg and Gina McCarthy noted in their powerful op-ed this week, it doesn’t have to be this way. We must expect more from our leaders. Recovery will require the recognition that a healthy economy cannot exist without healthy people—and that includes the most vulnerable among us.
