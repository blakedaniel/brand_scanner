**Hot Topic: Doomsday scenarios.** New studies this week present a sobering picture of planetary emissions and the havoc they are wreaking on our natural systems. First, a study from the International Energy Agency (IEA) found that the fossil fuel industry is failing to tackle methane emissions despite its pledges to uncover and fix leaking infrastructure. The report noted that fossil fuel companies could reduce these emissions by 75% using *existing* technologies—and with less than 3% of their $4 trillion in investment profits from last year alone—yet have failed to take necessary action.


Next, two new studies found that global heating is weakening the Antarctic’s ‘doomsday glacier’ and its eventual breakup could raise sea levels by more than two feet, enough to submerge parts of coastal cities worldwide.  What’s more, if the ice surrounding the glacier also disintegrates, it could raise sea levels by another 10 feet, devastating U.S. coastal cities like New York, New Orleans and Miami, not to mention the global impact.


In yet another study, researchers found that the current rate of species loss is faster than during any of the previous five mass extinctions on Earth. Many scientists believe that current biodiversity losses mark the acceleration of a new mass extinction, and that total ecosystem collapse is “inevitable” if the losses are not reversed.


In the face of growing evidence of the compounding effects of climate change, experts are increasingly considering the need for new and novel bioengineering projects. In just one example, a new report from the UN suggests that emergency, temporary Solar Radiation Modification (SRM) measures, which reflect solar sunlight away from earth and back to space, may become necessary if resistance to reducing emissions holds strong.


SRM and other measures, however, pose risks, are in nascent stages, and cannot alone replace emissions reductions, which are *essential* to slowing the climate crisis. That means that the corporations that have long benefited from polluting and heating the planet—and the governments that regulate them—must act immediately to draw down fossil fuel use, the one solution already at hand that can preserve our planet’s future.
