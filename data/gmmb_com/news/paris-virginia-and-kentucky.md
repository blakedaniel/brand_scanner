Hot Topic: Politics. In a long-expected move, the Trump administration formally notified the United Nations on Monday that it will withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement. The move came on the first day possible under the accord’s complex rules, and starts the clock on the U.S. exit, which will go into effect on November 4, 2020—one day after the U.S. presidential election. The administration has cited the Agreement’s imposition of “intolerable burdens on the American economy” as the reason for withdrawal.
The decision has received substantial criticism internationally, and here in the U.S., leaders and citizens continue to fight back. Governors from 24 states and Puerto Rico formed the United States Climate Alliance to continue their work to meet Paris goals. Thousands of municipal, tribal, civic and business leaders have signed the We Are Still In declaration pledging the same. And voters made their wishes clear in state elections Tuesday that signaled, in part, the power of climate as an electoral issue.
In Virginia, the Democratic Party embraced an aggressive clean energy stance and took control of both the House and Senate. Ahead of the election, polls showed that more than 60 percent of Virginians wanted government action on climate, and the issue was a top concern young Virginia voters. The news in Kentucky was no less dramatic, with the Democratic candidate securing a narrow victory over the climate change-doubting governor in a state that voted for Mr. Trump by a 30-point margin in 2016.  Above all, these results are a sign of hope that America may once again retake its place on the right side of history once the American majority that supports climate action has had its say.
