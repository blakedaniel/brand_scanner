 Fires Burn, Oceans Bake And People Push Back

**Hot Topic: Urgency and action.**This week, for the second time in its history, *Time* magazine turned every page of its coverage to one single issue: climate change. The first time the magazine took this step—30 years ago, in 1989—no one was paying attention. This time we have no choice, as fires rage around the globe, storms bring devastation to entire nations and dangerous ocean heatwaves threaten devastation to marine life and the livelihoods that depend upon it.


As the stories below demonstrate, the need for urgent action shows increasing signs of breaking through. Major corporations are pushing back against the Administration’s efforts to slash environmental regulations. Employees are standing up and walking out to demand that their companies take action. All the major Democratic presidential candidates have released comprehensive climate plans. And polling shows that there is virtually no difference between Republicans 18-38 and Democrats on the need for climate action.


Next week, youth around the world will strike to demand a course correction on climate from their leaders, and we look forward to joining them in the fight.
