| **Hot Topic: Protecting our air.** Climate change degrades air quality and air pollution exacerbates climate change. It’s a vicious cycle, and low-income and minority communities suffer the worst impacts. Yet another study out this week exemplifies the disparity, finding that schools in Utah serving economically disadvantaged neighborhoods of color are exposed to higher levels of air pollution, thanks to long-standing segregation that has clustered minority communities in urban areas near industrial parks and busy roadways.
This week, three groups took steps to fight for cleaner air. Two separate coalitions made up of 23 states and a dozen environmental groups sued the Trump administration for rolling back fuel efficiency standards. Health workers from more than 200 organizations signed a letter urging leaders to prioritize a shift to renewable energy in stimulus packages to protect public health. And the EU unveiled an $826 billion package that prioritizes sustainable projects and a climate-friendly economic recovery from COVID-19.
This week we sat down with Paul Billings, national senior vice president of public policy for the American Lung Association, to discuss the impacts of climate change on air quality, disparities in minority communities and protecting the Clean Air Act. As he emphasized, *every* family has the right to clean air, and it will take strong leadership and action to protect the families in our most vulnerable communities.
