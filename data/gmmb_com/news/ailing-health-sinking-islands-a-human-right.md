***The Climate, Health & Equity Brief is GMMB’s take on the week’s news on the current impacts of climate change. If you haven’t subscribed yet, you can do so by [clicking here](https://mailchimp.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=f2f8c4bdabe1a2a83f914e813&id=4a13a601e2).***


**Hot Topic:** **Health in peril.** Two weeks ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow, three new reports have confirmed the urgent need for climate action from governments and corporations alike and are sounding the alarm for human health and wellbeing if ambitious pledges aren’t enacted fast.


First, the World Health Organization released a report warning that climate change is now the single biggest threat to public health globally, with climate-related hazards such as heatwaves, extreme storms, drought, rapidly increasing water- and food-borne illnesses and mental health crises taking an increasingly troublesome toll on the state of human health. Second, a new UN study found that water management systems worldwide are inadequate in the face of climate impacts, forecasting that five billion people will not have sufficient access to water by 2050.


Finally, a new analysis in the journal Nature has found that at least 85 percent of the global population has experienced the impacts of weather events made worse by climate change—from floods and heatwaves to crop failures—and that rising temperatures have taken a toll on at least 80 percent of the world’s landmass. These metrics likely fail to tell the whole story, however, as the same report found a significant lack of studies examining climate impacts in the Global South—particularly among African and Pacific Island nations.


And island nation communities face particular peril. At least 11 islands have already been swallowed whole by rising seas, and at least 13 more—including well-known destinations such as the Maldives, Seychelles, Cook Islands and Fiji—are on track to be submerged within the next 80 years. The threat is so severe that some island nation leaders have already initiated plans to relocate their entire populations to ensure their safety.


The UN Human Rights Council approved a first-of-its-kind resolution this week, calling access to a “safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment” a human right. Just in time for COP26, this underscores that the climate crisis is a human rights crisis—and ambitious climate action is imperative to protect the health, safety and dignity of present and future populations.

#### Human Health


New [research](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01168-6) from the journal *Nature* revealed that at least [85 percent](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/10/11/85-percent-population-climate-impacts/) of the global population has experienced climate-fueled extreme weather, and that four-fifths of the world’s land area has suffered impacts linked to climate change. (The Washington Post)


In a new [report](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/cop26-special-report) prepared for COP26, the WHO warns that climate change is the [single biggest threat](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/climate-change-health-threat-who/) to public health, urging world leaders to help address the climate crisis through significant commitments including a green recovery from COVID-19 and sustainable food systems. (CBS News)


A new [study](https://library.wmo.int/fb.php?title=2021%20State%20of%20Climate%20Services%20%28WMO-No.%201278%29&url=index.php%3Flvl%3Dnotice_display%26id%3D21963#.YWc6rgIk_oX.link) from the UN World Meteorological Organization found that water management systems worldwide are inadequate in the face of climate impacts, forecasting that five billion people will not have sufficient [access to water](https://apnews.com/article/business-united-nations-floods-droughts-water-management-9fea3f6558b578a9acfa0835b577f959) by 2050. (AP News)


#### Equity


A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01168-6) published by the journal *Nature* found that climate change studies are [twice as likely](https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/11/world/climate-change-attribution-gap/index.html) to focus on impacts in wealthier countries across Europe and North America than low-income countries such as those in Africa and the Pacific Islands. (CNN)


[Pacific Islanders](https://www.axios.com/climate-change-pacific-islands-activism-un-93221bd2-c6ae-44d7-8456-e66209f1656e.html) are calling on world leaders to step up their climate commitments, as they are already experiencing severe consequences of climate change, losing some islands entirely to rising sea levels, with even more set to [disappear](https://www.rd.com/list/islands-will-disappear-80-years/) in the coming decades. (Axios, Reader’s Digest)

#### Politics & Economy


A new [report](https://firststreet.org/research-lab/published-research/highlights-from-infrastructure-on-the-brink/) found that one in four units of critical [infrastructure](https://www.axios.com/flood-risk-united-states-critical-infrastructure-a8703d5b-8d95-4584-8bc3-4ea086b83cfa.html) across the U.S.—including airports, fire stations, hospitals, police stations, ports and power stations—are at risk of being inoperable due to increasingly frequent and intense flooding fueled by climate change. (Axios)


The UN Human Rights Council voted to recognize the human right to a “safe, clean, healthy and sustainable [environment](https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/08/world/un-clean-environment-human-right-climate-intl/index.html)” and created a new organizational role to investigate the human rights impact of climate change. (CNN)


A new NOAA [report](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/) found that just 18 weather disasters in the U.S. this year have together totaled [$104.8 billion in damages](https://www.insider.com/us-has-had-18-1-billion-weather-disasters-this-year-2021-10) and caused at least 538 deaths. (Insider)


According to a new [report](https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2021) by the International Energy Agency, fossil fuel use is expected to [peak](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/13/climate/global-fossil-fuel-use.html) in the middle of this decade before beginning its decline, but without more aggressive action, current policies will still lead to catastrophic warming of 2.6°C (4.7°F). (The New York Times)


#### Action


Two dozen additional countries have joined a U.S.-and-EU-led pledge to cut [methane emissions](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/exclusive-us-eu-line-up-over-20-more-countries-global-methane-pact-2021-10-11/) by 30 percent by 2030, with all signatories accounting for 30 percent of global methane emissions. (Reuters)


Scientists have developed a new [grain](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/interactive/2021/bread-baking-sustainable-grain-kernza/) that could present a solution to the climate crisis from farming, due to its perennial nature and ability to capture carbon dioxide in the air. (The Washington Post)
