***The Climate, Health & Equity Brief is GMMB’s take on the week’s news on the current impacts of climate change. If you haven’t subscribed yet, you can do so by [clicking here](https://mailchimp.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=f2f8c4bdabe1a2a83f914e813&id=4a13a601e2).***


**Hot Topic:** **Survey says.**A new POLITICO Global Sustainability Poll released this week found that a majority of respondents in the 13 countries surveyed say they are concerned about the climate crisis, including majorities among *right-leaning* voters in every country except Australia (which fell just short at 49 percent). The poll also showed that people think their political leaders are failing miserably on climate action, and major corporations should take on a much larger role.


These results follow a multi-country survey of 16-to-25-year-olds in which more than half of respondents said “humanity is doomed” in the face of the climate crisis. With the benefit of such insights, it’s no surprise that eco-anxiety has gone mainstream among mental health professionals in recent years. As *The New York Times* notes this week, the Climate Psychology Alliance now provides an online directory of climate-aware therapists, one nonprofit has started a 12-step program to help people deal specifically with climate grief, and professional certification programs in climate psychology are proliferating.


For those closely following the news, this evolution is no surprise. Just this week, several reports have delivered yet more concerning news: Mount Everest has lost 2,000 years’ worth of ice in the last 25 years. Twenty-five major companies that together are responsible for five percent of global emissions are failing to meet their own climate goals and regularly exaggerate their progress. Changes to the habitable ranges of insects mean it’s highly likely that disease-spreading mosquitoes will migrate and multiply, while vital pollinator bees will continue a sharp decline. And in California, the second wildfire of the winter signal that ‘wildfire season’ may now be a year-round phenomenon.

#### Human Health


Once considered speculative, [climate anxiety](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.nytimes.com/2022/02/06/health/climate-anxiety-therapy.html__;!!HhhKMSGjjQV-!tg4dsLCVlCp8ij8ZCmnlNEgfoK2Bof7TXAp-fn2npvhxFG2xm59xhAnQGrKmhZhS%24) has now entered the mainstream as therapists treat more patients suffering from existential dread and the field of climate psychology expands among mental health professionals. (The New York Times)


A new [study](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/particulate-matter-pm-basics__;!!HhhKMSGjjQV-!tg4dsLCVlCp8ij8ZCmnlNEgfoK2Bof7TXAp-fn2npvhxFG2xm59xhAnQGibmG_uR%24) attributed [1.8 million global deaths](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/02/06/air-pollution-urban/__;!!HhhKMSGjjQV-!tg4dsLCVlCp8ij8ZCmnlNEgfoK2Bof7TXAp-fn2npvhxFG2xm59xhAnQGkZISL0m%24) in 2019 to particulate matter exposure, and found that 86 percent of urban dwellers worldwide live with air pollution levels seven times greater than World Health Organization guidelines. (The Washington Post)


#### Planetary Health


Increasing temperatures are forcing insect populations to move and adapt, raising fears about the [survivability](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/jan/11/climate-change-insect-world-global-heating-species) of many insect species, including bees, which are essential for pollination and have already experienced significant population decreases across North America and Europe. (The Guardian)


In a new [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-022-00230-0), scientists warn that Mount Everest’s highest glacier is losing decades worth of water annually due to planetary warming, threatening rapid [glacial melt](https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/03/asia/mount-everest-climate-ice-glacier-melt-intl/index.html) that could lead to more frequent avalanches and diminished water sources for 1.6 billion people in the Himalayan region. (CNN)


The Emerald fire in Laguna Beach, marks the second California wildfire this winter, signaling that with increasing temperatures, what was once a four-month wildfire season is increasingly becoming a [year-round](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/emerald-fire-laguna-beach-california-b2013023.html__;!!HhhKMSGjjQV-!on7ZlE6JyA5tBnDahOrucTZuDzpmPTNil7e5p9nuUqVvR0PT0UacywUwPlqN44DU%24) phenomenon in the state.

#### Equity


Insurers are reassessing their risk modeling practices after suffering tens of billions of dollars in losses from severe weather events in recent years, leaving homeowners facing escalating property [insurance premiums](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.nytimes.com/2022/02/04/business/retirement-climate-change-homeowners-insurance.html__;!!HhhKMSGjjQV-!on7ZlE6JyA5tBnDahOrucTZuDzpmPTNil7e5p9nuUqVvR0PT0UacywUwPl3f_EaR%24) and creating hardship for retirees reliant on fixed incomes.

#### Life as We Know It


A new [study](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021EF002434) found that increased [air conditioner use](https://phys.org/news/2022-02-household-air-conditioning-electric-capacity.html) in the U.S. due to rising temperatures could cause electricity demand to increase as much as 13 percent during summer seasons, contributing more to planetary warming and threatening to cause prolonged blackouts if states do not increase energy efficiency or capacity. (Phys.org)


#### Action


The U.S Department of Agriculture has pledged [$1 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/07/usda-to-spend-1-billion-on-agriculture-projects-tackling-climate-change.html) to help the farming industry implement climate-friendly agricultural solutions in hopes of curbing the sector’s high greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S.  (CNBC)
