Protecting America’s Children and Families
==========================================

 


















In partnership with the Georgetown Center for Children and Families (CCF), and with the support of The David and Lucile Packard Foundation, GMMB works to protect and advance health coverage for America’s children and families.  

 

















Through the Finish Line Project, we work with CCF and more than 30 nonprofit grantees in 20 states, providing technical assistance to adapt effective messaging and communications strategies to address the unique dynamics at play in each state. This customized support includes developing messaging, collateral and social graphics, event and earned media strategies, social media, and digital strategy and more.

Through our work, we’ve elevated the value of Medicaid and helped to protect  the vital health coverage it provides for millions of children and families.
