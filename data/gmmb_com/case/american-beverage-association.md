* Corporate Social Impact













Consumer Education Programs
===========================

 



* American Beverage Association





















America’s leading beverage companies, led by the American Beverage Association (ABA) and with GMMB as the strategic communications partner, have been working for more than a decade on solutions to help fight childhood obesity. To take these efforts to the next level, ABA called on GMMB to develop and implement a consumer education campaign on the importance of balance and moderation.

 

















Research with moms and teens showed that while balance isn’t top of mind for teens, they inherently understand a basic three-part formula: balance what you eat and drink with what you do.

 






























To reach teens, GMMB developed and launched *Mixify™* — a national consumer awareness program on social media, digital and TV advertising, and a website, *MyMixify.com*, with online tips and tools to support teens in easy ways. The campaign also reached parents so they knew the message the industry was delivering to their teens.

GMMB developed and managed the *Mixify™* Tour, bringing the balance message directly to teens across America.

The campaign advertising reached more than 25 million teens and 22 million moms of teens. More than one million users visited the campaign website, and the campaign generated more than 35,000 mentions on social media and more than 111,000 followers.
