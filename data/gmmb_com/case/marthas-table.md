* Martha's Table













* Media Relations














Martha’s Table, in Washington, D.C., supports strong children, families, and communities by increasing access to education, healthy food, and family resources.

GMMB was engaged to increase Martha’s Table’s visibility among D.C. leaders and policymakers, community members, and current and potential donors, leverage its new Ward 8 presence in media coverage, and showcase the organization’s expanded focus on education and parent and family support.

 

















GMMB developed core messages, conducted media training with spokespeople, and conducted media outreach resulting in stories in the Afro, the Washington Informer, and WJLA. The coverage resulted in 1.7 million estimated monthly visits to websites.

GMMB also helped plan a Martha’s Table-Lyft launch event where Lyft and corporate partners offered $2.50 rides to families in Wards 7 and 8 to get to and from the grocery store. GMMB secured coverage from WAMU, WHUR, WUSA9, and WRC (NBC 4) as well an editorial in the *Washington Post*.
