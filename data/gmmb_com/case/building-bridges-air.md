Building Bridges to a Brighter Tomorrow
=======================================

 



* AIR





















As the American Institutes for Research (AIR) approached its 75th anniversary, its work had evolved beyond traditional research in education to an expanded set of issue areas and methods. But relative to many of its peers AIR had an outdated brand identity that didn’t reflect its sophistication or mission-focus.

 

















Whereas AIR described its capabilities in siloes, we crafted a brand identity to position AIR as a bridge-builder—bridging knowledge, expertise, and ultimately gaps in outcomes and well-being.

 

 






























GMMB worked with AIR leadership to craft a series of brand values, a brand story, targeted messaging based on issue area, and a new tagline that reflected the start-and end-points of AIR’s bridge-building approach: “Advancing Evidence. Improving Lives.”  GMMB also crafted a new, modern logo and visual identity.

And finally, we worked with AIR’s digital team to map, wireframe, and design their new website, the most visible expression of their brand.
