The Commission on the Value of Postsecondary Education focuses on the economic return of education after high school, exploring past and present relationships among post-graduate earnings, location, the field of study, costs, and certificates. The Commission was eager to spread the word and build a community surrounding this initiative. 

 

















GMMB provided the Commission with a digital platform and unique visual brand to promote its year-long study.  With each page, visitors gain more in-depth insight through video interviews, photos, and content to learn about the Commission’s efforts. Our team partnered with the client to create a user flow that focused on essential content and resources. We tailored content to strengthen SEO search ranking and increase opportunities to reach new audiences.

We designed and developed a mobile-friendly experience into a secure, flexible WordPress website loads quickly for desktop and mobile audiences. We also integrated Constituent Relationship Management (CRM) forms into the site. As the Commission continues their work and presents their findings, they have a platform that can continue to grow and evolve with their efforts.
