Focus On Teen Health 

Washington State Health Care Authority

The Focus On campaign is a partnership supported by the Washington State Health Care Authority to help prevent underage use of alcohol and marijuana. The Digital team created a landing page for their campaign to show teens that they have alternatives and provide support for teens with their support phone lines. The landing page offers a clear and compelling layout using page animation and features such as a video, quiz slider, and different ways to engage with content.
