Young Adult Underage Drinking Prevention
========================================

 



* Washington State Health Care Authority





















In 2017, the Washington State Health Care Authority partnered with GMMB to develop and implement a statewide effort to prevent underage drinking among college students, ages 18-20.

After conducting research and concept testing, GMMB developed the *Rethinking College Drinking* campaign to educate college students about the risks and consequences of underage alcohol use, disrupt perceptions of drinking culture, and offer healthy ways to deal with stress, anxiety, and boredom — reasons students often cite for drinking.

 

















The *Rethinking College Drinking*campaign included posters, social ads, print ads, and radio spots.

The campaign also included a video that describes the BAR Lab experiment showing people don’t need alcohol to be social, along with a series of Q&A videos with experts. 

 























































GMMB also developed *NotAMomentWasted.org*, a website with alcohol and marijuana prevention information and resources, plus a toolkit to share campaign assets with partners. Overall, the campaign generated a total of 28,780,540 impressions and 2,074,141 video completions.
