Improving Quality Prenatal Nutrition
====================================

 



* Kirk Humanitarian













* Brand Strategy, Digital Strategy, Web Design














The Kirk Humanitarian mission is to accelerate the use of multiple micronutrient supplements (MMS) for women at risk of undernutrition during pregnancy in the developing world. GMMB refreshed their logo and redesigned Kirk Humanitarian’s website to provide a more contemporary look and feel to elevate its mission. 

 

















Our Digital team partnered with Kirk to revise their website structure and navigation. We worked with our designers to create a clean, mobile-friendly design that features a compelling narrative and images that conveyed respect and dignity for their beneficiaries.

The site also provides an easily searchable index of resources and information for their audiences and a key call to action to join their mission. Kirk Humanitarian now has a digital platform that can increase awareness and engagement to ensure that more women are well-nourished and equipped to have safe pregnancies.
