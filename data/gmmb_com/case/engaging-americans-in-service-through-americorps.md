Engaging Americans in Service 

AmeriCorps

AmeriCorps, the government agency powering national service for communities across the country, tapped GMMB to be its strategic partner in raising their visibility and engaging more Americans in service. Our work spanned research and messaging, creative content development, paid media campaign strategy, media outreach, and partnership building.  
We’ve developed innovative, motivational creative concepts and assets. Through national and targeted paid media planning and execution, we’ve raised awareness of AmeriCorps and led people of all ages to apply and volunteer in their communities. 
And finally, with our strategic media outreach, we’ve secured hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of PSA placements, told the incredible stories of volunteers through secured coverage in top media outlets, and developed partnership opportunities with Discovery, Univision, A+E, and MTV. We’re proud to support AmeriCorps and the millions of Americans who get things done for their communities and our country.
