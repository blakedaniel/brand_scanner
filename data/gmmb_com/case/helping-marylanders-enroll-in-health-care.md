Since 2015, GMMB has worked to get more Marylanders covered through the state’s health insurance marketplace, Maryland Health Connection. Each year’s open enrollment campaign efforts are informed by market research and data analytics. The result is on-message and fresh creative executions brought to life through fully integrated advertising campaigns, community engagement, collateral, video content, and earned media. 
To reach priority audiences, including Black and Hispanic Marylanders, the campaign works closely with local influencers and media personalities, as well as community-based organizations, to deliver culturally relevant content. 
 
Maryland’s innovative policy changes have led to new campaigns to enroll consumers during tax season and the longest-running COVID special enrollment period in the country. As a result, Maryland is a leader among states in enrollment. 
The state’s uninsured rate has dropped to an historic low and most recently, in 2021, the marketplace reached all-time high enrollment levels.
