Assistance for Small Businesses
===============================

 










* Opportunity Finance Network














Nationwide, nearly 8 million minority-owned small businesses and nearly 9.1 million women-owned small businesses help power their communities. These entrepreneurs require capital to effectively run their businesses, but face barriers to accessing the funds they need. In 2015, the Opportunity Finance Network (OFN) asked GMMB to develop a campaign to help them better understand their borrowing options and better prepare for the loan application process.Â 

 

















Our research-based, digital-first campaign was called Venturize. It included a website that provided clear and trustworthy information for small business owners to explore lenders and loans types.

GMMB also managed all social media strategy and implementation of the Venturize Facebook and Twitter channels. Through these efforts, and a targeted earned and paid media push on the news and information channels most frequented by entrepreneurs, Venturize exceeded 50 million impressions, and over 300,000 small business owners visited the campaign website within six months of launch.
