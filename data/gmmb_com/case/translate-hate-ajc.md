Building Understanding to Fight Antisemitism
============================================

 



* American Jewish Committee













* Digital Strategy, Web Design














From the march in Charlottesville to the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, it was clear that antisemitism in this country was on the rise. And while blatant violence, remarks and symbols are easy to spot, veiled hatred is often harder to detect and call out. To mark the anniversary of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, the American Jewish Committee (AJC) came to GMMB to develop an education campaign about what antisemitism is and why its existence and resurgence is a threat to all those who believe in democracy. More specifically, we were charged with targeting socially engaged, thoughtful Americans (both Jews and non-Jews) to spark conversation on social and at community events. However, we knew that in order to change behavior, people have to understand it and learn how to spot it.

 

















The solution? Develop a digital-first educational tool to put a spotlight on hate that lives both on and offline.

We worked with our clients to create a glossary that lived as a digital hub housing social assets, a hero video and ways to take action. Our glossary eventually was turned into a printed booklet that has been translated into multiple languages and used in a variety of settings to help people understand why hateful language can be so harmful.
