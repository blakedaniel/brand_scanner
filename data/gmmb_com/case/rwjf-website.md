Documenting an Initiative’s Success
===================================

 



* The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation













* Web Design














The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation funded the *Together for Healthy and Successful Schools* initiative to better understand the dynamics that come together in communities to create healthy schools. 

 

















The website we created for RWJF provides a narrative that outlines the Foundation’s support for this program, from their grantees to state and community initiatives.

The website is designed specifically to the content, showing rich, compelling images and colors for each section, along with calls to action to download materials and resources.
