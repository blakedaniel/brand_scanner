BUILD Initiative

Brand Strategy, Digital Strategy, Web Design 
The BUILD Initiative helps state leaders create policies, infrastructure, and connections to advance comprehensive, high-quality, and equitable programs, services and supports for young children, their families and communities. BUILD approached GMMB to help combine their two outdated, existing organizational websites into one new interactive, dynamic and easy-to-navigate site for their audiences of early childhood advocates, state and local leaders and foundations. 
GMMB took on this complex challenge with a user-focused, content-first approach—helping BUILD create a comprehensive online resource in the early childhood community.  
 
In an iterative process, GMMB worked with BUILD to organize and develop content, manage a largescale resource library, create an interactive event calendar and design a clean, modern look for their organization. With our combined expertise in early childhood and top-notch understanding of digital strategy, GMMB helped BUILD launch a brand-new site and robust resource library in the summer of 2021.
