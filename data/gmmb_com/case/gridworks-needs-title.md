Decarbonizing the Grid
======================

 



* Gridworks





















Gridworks is a California-based organization whose mission is to convene, educate and empower stakeholders working to decarbonize electricity grids. As they began to expand their reach to other western states in early 2020, GMMB stepped in to provide messaging and strategy support to ensure that communications were clear and consistent throughout its expansion. We began with an analysis of existing Gridworksâ€™ messaging materials and conducted research into the clean energy landscape in key western states. These insights informed a tailored message framework and supporting materials including a 10 question FAQ, elevator pitch, and core messages for Gridworks stakeholders.

 

















Our initial engagement culminated in a training for all Gridworks stakeholders and long-term strategy recommendations to inform state expansion as well as an overarching communications plan and ongoing support from GMMB.
