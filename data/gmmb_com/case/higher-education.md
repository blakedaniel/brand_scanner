The Value of Higher Education
=============================

 


















The leading indicator of whether someone will graduate from college isn’t intelligence, test scores or “grit.” It’s family income. 

We’ve helped raise awareness that the majority of today’s college students are older and often have children and jobs, and then we helped promote promising approaches, interventions, and policies that support them.

We helped Bloomberg Philanthropies’ College Point show how its free, online counseling helps more low-income, high-achieving high school students attend the colleges they deserve.

For the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, GMMB is a long-time strategic partner in making higher education more affordable, accessible, and rewarding for all students — especially those with low incomes and diverse backgrounds — through reforming the FAFSA and advocating for students, families, policymakers, and institutions to have better information to make key decisions. For New America, we helped draw national media attention to its research on perceptions of higher education.
