* Corporate Social Impact













Communicating and Promoting Safety
==================================

 



* Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety





















Following the tragic Rana Plaza building collapse in 2013, 26 leading North American apparel brands came together to form the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety — and they called upon GMMB to amplify their commitment dramatically improving safety in Bangladesh garment factories.

 

 

















GMMB built and executed a strategy to highlight Alliance achievements on inspections, factory remediation, worker safety training, and an anonymous worker helpline. In response to this work, the public narrative about the effort shifted from skepticism about the about the commitment of retailers to praise for the Alliance as a model of corporate citizenship.

By responding swiftly to attacks and amplifying the voices and achievements of Alliance member companies, GMMB helped achieve positive coverage in top-tier U.S. publications including *The New York Times*, *The Wall Street Journal*, Reuters, and Bloomberg. Today, the work of the Alliance is held up as a symbol of what can be accomplished when corporations work together for the common good.
