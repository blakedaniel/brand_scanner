Medicaid Expansion for Cancer Patients
======================================

 



* American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network













* Paid Media and Analytics, Production














Medicaid is critical for those facing life-threatening diseases like cancer. To raise awareness about the importance of Medicaid, GMMB supported American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network in branding and launching the *Medicaid Covers US* campaign in six states where Medicaid expansion was being considered or threatened.

 

















The centerpiece of the campaign was an online storybook featuring beneficiaries, caregivers, and health care workers impacted by Medicaid aiming to counter stereotypes and show how the program benefits communities. The campaign also included digital advertising driving audiences to the storybook, a partner toolkit, and materials for distribution.

The campaign was well-received by partners, thought leaders, and the public. The digital advertising campaign exceeded benchmarks with a .26% click through rate and delivered 62 million impressions. Most importantly, the campaign led to important conversations about the benefits of Medicaid and how it must be protected.
