Demanding Fairness from Drug Companies
======================================

 



* AARP





















Americans pay more for prescription drugs than anyone else in the world. And for many the costs are devasting. GMMB joined forces with AARP to develop the campaign “Stop Rx Greed” to fight back. 

 

















The campaign launched in early 2019 with “Rx View” a TV spot that laid bare the harsh reality that the drug companies don’t see us as people, they see us a profits. 

 











































In 2020, the campaign continued with “The Fight” a TV ad that made it clear that AARP and its 38 million members will keep fighting for lower drug prices for all Americans. 

 

















The campaign is also continuing at the state level with print, digital and radio ads pushing for state and federal legislative action and Americans to take action.
