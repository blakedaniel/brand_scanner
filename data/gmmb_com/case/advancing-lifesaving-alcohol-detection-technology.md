Drunk driving claims over 10,000 lives a year in the U.S. The Driver Alcohol Detection System for Safety (DADSS) Program, a partnership between the U.S. government and the worldâ€™s leading automakers, is developing in-vehicle alcohol detection technology to help save lives.

DADSS hired GMMB to help build consumer awareness, acceptance, and demand for the technology. GMMB has developed videos, presentations, and messages to convey the lifesaving potential of the technology and bring the research and development process to life.

Virginia became the first state to partner with the DADSS Program. GMMB helped launch the Driven to Protect initiative, creating the brand, messaging, materials and digital presence.

We have also partnered with Virginia schools to share interactive content, virtual lessons, and videos that provide a deeper understanding of the dangers of alcohol-impaired driving and share how data, science, innovation, and technology can be used to save lives.
