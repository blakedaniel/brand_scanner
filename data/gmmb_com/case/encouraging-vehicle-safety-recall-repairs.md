Media Relations 
Through programs like the Safe Cars Save Lives campaign, GMMB provides multi-level communications support to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to promote vehicle safety measures that reduce deaths and injuries on America’s roads. 
In 2020, NHTSA administered recalls to more than 55 million vehicles; yet in any given year 25% of recalled vehicles are still unrepaired—putting drivers and passengers at risk. The Safe Cars Save Lives National Recalls and the Geotargeted Takata Air Bag Recalls campaigns use targeted messaging, high-impact creative and top-performing paid media buys to raise awareness of the risks involved with open vehicle safety recalls and communicate the urgency of checking for and repairing recalls for free. 
In 2021, GMMB planned, launched, and managed three paid digital media campaigns to drive audiences to check their vehicle for recalls at nhtsa.gov/recalls, resulting in a total of 166 million impressions and over 1.36 million recall checks. 
 
 
GMMB’s use of these materials produced for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is for the purpose of providing examples of its work and does not constitute an endorsement by NHTSA.
