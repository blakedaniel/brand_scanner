Championing Better Health Care
==============================

 



* The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation





















Through our work with State Health and Value Strategies (SHVS), we have helped launch state-based marketplaces, expand Medicaid programs, and enroll consumers in private and public health coverage options. As health reforms evolve, our work also includes helping states implement delivery system changes and address social determinants of health.Â 

We assist more than a dozen states across the political spectrum, working directly with health insurance marketplaces, Medicaid agencies, insurance departments and other state entities to effectively implement reforms to improve, expand, and enhance affordable health coverage. We help states mitigate barriers to coverage and care and improve health outcomes as the system moves in an increasingly value-based direction.

GMMB provides in-depth support and strategic guidance as states communicate changes in health care and work to get residents enrolled. Through one-on-one technical assistance, research and analysis, and message development, we have a constant pulse on pressing issues, promising practices and strategies to drive implementation success.
