Empowering Women
================

 



* YWCA













* Brand Strategy, Digital Strategy














YWCA, a national non-profit that serves more than one thousand communities nationwide, had a powerful tagline: “Eliminating racism. Empowering women.” And their visual identity was bold, bright, and personal. But the organization lacked a defining narrative — a singular story rooted in YWCA’s mission and positioning it for the years to come. 

 

















GMMB conducted a brand audit, stakeholder interviews and held a brand summit to inform the new brand story we created, which defined YWCA as an active, mission-focused organization that does the work of justice. This new language has been incorporated in YWCA’s collateral, fundraising, and general communications.

GMMB also developed YWCA ‘s first Giving Tuesday campaign, combining the language we developed with powerful new visuals to seek support, and created a video at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic highlighting the heightened need for food and shelter for families; childcare for first responders; and support for survivors of domestic violence.
