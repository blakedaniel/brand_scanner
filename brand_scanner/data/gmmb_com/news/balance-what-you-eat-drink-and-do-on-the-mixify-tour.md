 Balance What You Eat, Drink and Do on the Mixify Tour

This summer, GMMB worked with long-time client, the American Beverage Association, to take their Mixify program on the road with the Mixify Tour. From Los Angeles to Des Moines, the Mixify Tour truck traveled more than 6,500 miles to take the message of balance directly to teens in eleven cities across America.
Mixify is a national consumer awareness program to educate teens about balancing what they eat and drink with what they do. Through social media, paid advertising and a website hub, Mixify shares tips, tools and inspiration with teens about balancing the mix of their daily lives.
The Mixify Tour brought the balance message to life this summer with a 25-foot truck, outfitted with a DJ booth and space for teens to hang out. Each tour stop featured activities and contests—like giant Jenga, bean bag toss, silent disco, tug-o-war and more—to promote balance; fitness experts and registered dietitians to lead group exercises and answer teens’ questions; and plenty of branded giveaways so teens could take the balance message with them after the event.
GMMB worked closely with local community groups in every city—Boys & Girls Clubs, YMCAs, etc.—to drive teen traffic to the events. Community outreach, along with social and digital advertising, resulted in connecting with more than 1,400 teens in the first ten cities of the tour. The Mixify Tour spent three days at the last stop, the Iowa State Fair, where we shared the balance message with more than 1,000 people every day.
Social media engagement was a critical component of the Mixify Tour to drive attendance ahead of the events and extend the reach of the balance message during and after each event to teens who were not able to attend. We engaged social media influencers and promoted the use of the tour hashtag—#MixifyTour—to keep the conversation going all summer long. There were more than 18,000 mentions of #MixifyTour on social media, and #MixifyTour was even a top trending hashtag in Portland during the event. Community groups, local organizations and even professional athletes promoted the tour and joined the conversation.
The Mixify Tour was a great way to bring the balance message to life for teens in a meaningful way. Britney W., a teen at Mixify Tour: Chicago, said it best when she said, “This was a really fun way to think about balancing what I’m eating and drinking with what I’m doing. I’m committed to find more balance this summer by drinking more water, going on walks and eating more fruit.”
